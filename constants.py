    from eli5_defi's thread
    Do you know the history of the Bong Bears? Check out the Bonga Bera 101 - "For all the Beras that came before, Present, and in da Future: Here is our Collective History, Bonga Bera 101".  Or you could just keep reading ahead…*
    “Berachain is a developing EVM-compatible blockchain leveraging its unique “Proof-of-Liquidity” consensus to allow users to stake layer 1, bluechip DeFi, and stablecoin assets with Berachain validators. It sprouted as an idea from the Bong Bears NFT community, and it is built with the Cosmos-SDK. The chain operates around a tri-token structure consisting of $BERA, $BGT, and $HONEY.”* Intro from Wait, It’s Real? What is Berachain?
    You may be a bera, or you may have seen beras on CT relentlessly FUD’ing their own bags, or having more fun during the bear market than seems real or reasonable, or just generally engaging in absurd copypasta. But what is Berachain?
    Berachain is primed to launch soon. It is a shiny new L1 which leverages a multitude of the current metanarratives circulating around CT. Baked in at the protocol layer out of the box there will be: deep liquidity, real yield, the DeFi Trinity (borrow/lend, stable, swaps), perps, liquid staking derivatives (LSDs), NFTFi fueled by a strong DeFi/NFT degen culture, cosmos x EVM meme, memetic (memecoin/memechain) misunderstanding, shiny L1 rotation play, as well as an absurdist irreverent cult.
    “Berachain's lore is the memetic Trojan Horse behind what will be DeFi's deepest and most productive liquidity pools.” - Smokey, co-founder of Berachain
    But what is the best way to get exposure to this compound of meta? Up till now Bong Bears and rebases, which are gud jpegs, have been one of the few ways to get exposure. But with the soaring bera prices, even during the bera market, exposure is still out of financial reach for many degens… until now. Enter stage left, The Honey Jar… but you’ll have to wait for the alfa.
    These days it’s heretical for a Bera to break the code of Ooga Booga and speak in full sentences with minimal copypasta (or one of our stoned sessions with chatGPT got a little out of control) but we feel it’s worth it to shill the upcoming launch of The Honey Jar’s Honeycomb games, which looks potentially poised to become one of the premier, financially accessible ways to get exposure to the Berachain ecosystem. But before that, what’s the deal with Berachain? Is it real? Is it a cult? Why should you care? How did we get here? Lets jump down the bear hole to see how deep it goes…
    ((For those of you who, like Smokey, can’t read scroll to the end of this post for a picture visualisation of Berachain.))
    From Riley_gmi’s thread
    The Infinite Game with the Metagame plugin
    “Participating in crypto markets during the thrill stages of a bull-run” writes Cobie, CT’s resident town square drunk, “is isomorphically more similar to playing a modern video game than it is to investing.” In his ‘Trading the metagame’ piece, Cobie asserts that most competitive modern video games have an ever-evolving metagame (a subset of the game’s basic strategy) which you need to understand to play the game at a high level - just like crypto. An example given is the L1 rotation metagame in play since 2017, which is the premise that whilst Ethereum’s fees price out the majority of users, there is edge in rotating funds to other emergent L1s to reap their benefits.
    Papa Fisk agrees
    We liked this article, but feel like it’s missing the pre-eminent foundational layer to the game (not to mention how game dynamics differ during bera markets). With the advent of crypto - more specifically cryptography + blockchains + digital networks - everything has become part of the game. We’re already agents in a crypto-drunk metaverse, no VR goggles needed. Sorry Zuck… Let us explain.
    SCS knows
    You wake up and with half open eyes you fumble around as you reach for your serotonin/dopamine modulator. A few quick hits from CT or your portfolio, a few henlos and ooga boogas to get you rolling to the kitchen where you’ll mainline your first caffeine fix of the day. These dopamine hits from the degen digital dungeon masters guide you to whichever flavor of chaos dominates today’s game. These habits are already interwoven with our nervous systems in our personally and algorithmically tweaked augmented reality. Simon Sinek called an aspect of this ‘The Infinite Game’.
    The most seggsy picture of Zuck without photoshop.
    “Finite games, like football or chess, have known players, fixed rules, and a clear endpoint. The winners and losers are easily identified. In infinite games, like business or politics or life itself, the players come and go, the rules are changeable, and there is no defined endpoint. There are no winners or losers in an infinite game, there is only ahead and behind.” - Simon Sinek, ‘The Infinite Game’.
    The Holy Trinity of Crypto (blockchains, wallets) + Cryptography (signing, encryption) + Digital Networks (the internet, digital media) propels us across dimensions, fusing meatspace with cyberspace into cypherspace. What can we learn from other “games” across space and time? And who are the players best suited to crypto-fueled Infinite Games?
    Blockchains as Religions
    Fiskantes, CT’s resident Jester, anti-main character we don’t deserve, and caffeine puritan troll, periodically touches on aspects of this game. A year after Cobie’s piece, his colleagues at Zee Prime Capital wrote about another aspect of the game. They posit an alternate thesis to Joel Monegro’s 2016 ‘Fat Protocols’ thesis (majority of value created is captured by protocols, not apps) called the Fat App (FAPP) thesis which hypothesizes: Most value accrues to an app (or a few apps) that provides a broad range of products. As they expand upon their thesis, ‘The Fappening’ describes blockchains as more akin to medieval religions than modern metropolitan cities.
    A little bera history lesson: In 1517, legend has it that Martin Luther nailed a piece of paper containing 95 revolutionary opinions to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, which triggered the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. Generally, these 95 opinions challenged the idea that believers should be so reliant on the Catholic Church, but should rather be more independent in following their faith.
    Zee Prime sees Ethereum as the medieval Roman Catholic Church. They suggest that applications of today are like precarious medieval towns beholden to the control (and taxation) of the Church. They equate The DAO Hack to the movement towards separation of powers between State and Church. Furthermore, the ETC devs are likened to Martin Luther hammering their ‘code is law’ thesis to the church door. In the olden times, this fracture of the Church weakened its monopoly, progressing society towards the growth of nation states and further separation of powers between State and Church. As a result, so the reasoning goes, the cities and principalities grew more independent and better able to accrue the value they generate for themselves.
    Bera Pope blesses ur waifus
    Free Imperial Cities
    While neat for its stated purposes, we feel that this Protestant Revolution comparison does not account for other material conditions and innovations which were happening at the same time, which are more fitting analogies for the coming Berachain Cambrian explosion.
    At the time of Luther’s revolutionary actions, there were 85 free imperial cities in Germany alone. These cities had moats of cash liquidity from previous kingdoms, ran with a great deal of autonomy, and embraced and leveraged new technologies (the printing press and the emerging merchant and banking sectors). Indeed this was the era when the Kingdom of Portugal was at its height - being the mercantile centre of the east-meets-west world, buoyed as it was by both financial and literal liquidity.
    In medieval times, free mercantile cities brought together financial liquidity from previous kingdoms (contemporary parallel: institutional capital) as well as liquidity from rising merchant trade (contemporary parallel: exogenous apps and protocols - think uniswap, aave, etc). They embraced innovations in boat building, legal organisational structures, and financial technologies enabled by the printing press. Fast forward to today. Which blockchain is best positioning itself to pull in institutional capital, incorporate DeFi protocols, and leverage innovative blockchain technologies? Smokey, Papa, and Dev Bear - with their experiences in TradFi, FAANG, and as DeFi degens - are archetypes of these Free Imperial City merchants of yore, and are poised to build the next metaphorical Kingdom of Portugal.
    This sets the stage for a counter thesis to both Joel Monegro’s 2016 ‘Fat Protocols’ thesis (the majority of value created is captured by protocols, not apps) and Zee Primes’ Fat App thesis (Most value accrues to an app (or a few apps) that provides a broad range of products). The Fat BERA Thesis goes something like this: Protocols with endogenous apps (AMMs, perps, stables, borrow/lending) which capture value and share with exogenous protocols, apps, and the cult (other stakeholders) will become prosperous zones of power (aka will be DeFi's deepest and most productive liquidity pools). Or as Smokey says; Ooga Booga for that Sticky Liquidity (Source? We made it up).
    Docs in some Sticky Liquidity
    In the Fat BERA thesis, the Protocol (or Religion of trade) is shared with the Apps (or cities). Just as these Free Imperial cities rose together as they embraced financial and technological innovation, so shall the apps within the Berachain ecosystem.
    Ok so Berachain is medieval Portugal with gud jpegs and a team of bong smoking Canadians (big red flag). But what about the other metanarratives circulating around CT? Deep liquidity, real yield, DeFi Trinity (borrow/lend, stable, swaps), perps, liquid staked derivatives (LSDs), NFTFi fueled by a strong DeFi degen/nft cult, memetic (memecoin/memechain) misunderstanding, shiny L1 rotation play, as well as an irreverent cult. Well, anon, Berachain’s got 'em all. Let's explore the cult facet.
    PvP in Ghost Town
    BvB knife fight in a zombie L1
    “I’ll play the L1 rotation game, ‘cos I don’t wanna leave money on the table, but I don’t know what most of these copy paste L1s have to offer - they just seem hollow” - Chainlink God on Flywheel pod
    The Alt-L1s we’d like to focus on can be broadly broken up into three camps. Copypastas, Ghost L1s, and VC chains. In most of these cases when they first launch they are primarily sites for PvP knife fights between degens (1v1 rust knives only). Once a degen bridges to the chain (which can be hard), there isn't that much to do (mainly copypasta apps and protocols). It’s also the case that there isn’t really much organic community growth because who is truly devoted to a chain without real value. This means there’s going to need to be incentives which are often 0-sum games for the Religion (chain). These incentives will be provided either through distribution of grants or high emissions which often do not lead to anything much other than relentless dumping of the downonly governance tokens and very little organic engagement or traction. You may have noticed that any influencer who built their brand around, say, AVAX is no longer around.
    da condom nos
    With Berachain, this will not be an issue on either the protocol design side (things to do) nor the organic community side. Let's start with exploring the cult facet first…
    The Cult Theory of Change
    Sisyphus influenza and rugger extraordinaire
    Keeping in line with the medieval analogy, we can also summon the multitude of medieval cults as key stakeholders in the power struggles from that period. Cult, which shares the same root as culture (both bacteria and human), was initially used to describe those who glorified a saint, but in modern times has come to refer to ancient or even primitive religious practices (wagmi, gm, henlo, and furthermore, ooga booga, koolaid). So it is now, as it has always been, that new technologies such as the printing press and the printed materials that followed, are fervently propagated through culture by cults (source? we made it up).
    There is a CT narrative which sporadically circulates which states that cults fare well during bear markets. The Link marines are the prime example from the last bear market cycle (2018-2020) who managed to find gains where others could only crab or downonly, and whose culture fostered a fervent cult-like following. Typified by frog pfps and memes, ridiculous jokes, spontaneous community events and education, and eliciting strong emotions on either side of the aisle. Another key feature is the very low barrier to entry. Don a Frog PFP and away you go. Henlo? Welcome to the club…
    Had you listened to this influenza (even broken clocks are right twice a day) you would have done well this past year. The only jpegs to have done better than bong bears are the milady and pudgy penguin cults (also DeFi adjacent). But how else will these cult dynamics help the Berachain ecosystem beyond jpeg prices melting faces? I’m glad you asked.
    bears killed da apes but u woodn't believe
    The Cathedral and the Bazaar
    In a 1997 essay, and later a book called ‘The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source’, Eric Raymond, a “neo-pagan” with “batshit insane wingnut tendencies'' examined the struggles between top-down and bottom-up design in open source projects. He contrasted two different free software development models; on the one paw there is the Cathedral model, where source code is available upon release but developed by a restricted set of developers. And on the other paw there is the Bazaar model, originated by Linus Torvalds creator of Linux and git, the system which enabled the Bazaar model. The essay's central thesis is that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" (which he terms Linus's law). Cool history lesson grandpa - but what the fuck does this have to do with Link marines, cults, CT, and Berachain? Glad you asked you lickle shid. For that we need a lil moar early 2000s internet history.
    Power Law of Participation
    We can apply the studies of Wikipedia in 2006 by Ross Mayfield where he describes the Power Law of Participation as the combination of low barrier engagement and highly technical edge contributions. Dawn Foster applied this framework to studies done by Apache in 2000 which found that 80-90% of submissions came from 0.005% of the community. This concept applies similarly in studies of contributions to GNOME and a multitude of other open source projects. In CT parlance this starts with the “gm, henlo, furthermore, ooga booga, wagmi, copypasta” memes, and works all the way up to smart contract devs, and includes everything in between. Mayfield suggested patterns “have emerged where low threshold participation amounts to collective intelligence and high engagement provides a different form of collaborative intelligence”.
    zeus knew
    The archetypes here are the gm’s, henlo’s and ooga boogas for low threshold participation and 0xSami_, itsdevbear, ohmzeus, or 0xngmi for high threshold and inversebrah somewhere in between. The theory asserts that these multiple levels of engagement generate two very different forms of intelligence - collective and collaborative - which coexist together to form the essence of a community, or as we prefer to call it on CT: collective mental illness.
    What’s the point here? The point is that Berachain already has a metric fuck ton of this compared to most new L1s, and even to many that are already established. Core community members (e.g. itsdevbear, Smokey, etc) foster collaborative intelligence, while the larger community provides the important collective intelligence that contributes in the form of bug reports, ideas, comments, connections, memes and weird magic. The fusion of these types of contributions have historically allowed open source communities to be vibrant, but not prosperous.
    xkcd 2347
    Historically these communities, though rabid and devoted, have been vulnerable to corporate enclosures. Do open source development communities truly realize the gains from all their work, or do those contributions only further enrich those within the corporate structure? Decentralized blockchains have the newfound ability to turn this outdated structure on its head, where community vibrancy can now also directly translate into prosperity for those participating. But what the fuck does this have to do with Bazaars and Cults? Thanks for your patience, we’re almost there.
    Power Law of Participation + Bazaar + Cult = Culture
    When you apply the effects of the Bazaar and the Power Law of Participation with the context of the memetic lore of the Bong Bears, you get something which Janitooor has previously called Cult as a Service. This is the pattern where cypherpunks write code, busDevs leak alfa to the cult, the cult creates culture, the culture feeds the cypherpunks, which fuels busDevs in a feedback loop of ))<>((.
    devon's law; where's stickers tho?
    The key to all of this is the observations of ‘The Cathedral and the Bazaar' and ‘Power Laws of Participation’ which applied perfectly to the state of the internet of the early 2000s can also be applied to the new era of blockchain and web3. A key difference in the new blockchain paradigm is that all participants in the ecosystem can additionally become financial stakeholders in a way that was not previously possible. Where projects and communities have been vulnerable to corporate capture, they now have the means for economic sovereignty.
    Let’s apply this effect to our favorite blockchain. By the time Berachain launches (if it ever launches), there will already be a vibrant, organic and prosperous cult(ure) surrounding the project. Every single bera, whether they are participating in the form of henlos or are building novel bera protocols, are financial stakeholders who have much to gain from the success of the chain. Ever engaged in some bera copypasta? Better start believing in Memetic Electronic Computer Money Cults, bud; You're in one.
    inside the compuda
    Beras spread the bera culture that acts as a memetic pipeline into the ecosystem. FUDooors, trubelievers and new edge contributooors all contribute to the buzz. Bear markets are for the BUIDLooors - so the saying goes - but there is no denying that a very large percentage of the beras have fun regardless if it’s a bulla or bera. Indeed, the cult having fun and creating culture through bear or bull markets is a part of the work. When degens arrive to Berachain they will have a whole ecosystem of innovation and sticky liquidity to give them true incentives to stay, contribute, and gain financially, rather than just going through the PvP smash and grab which typifies most L1 rotation cycles.
    Arguably Olympus DAO’s key export from the last cycle was the memetic power of the (,) notation, even compared to the actual innovation of Protocol Owned Liquidity, Internal Bonds, and more recently Range Bound Stability. When (,) was replicated far and wide, that was memetics at work for Olympus. The beras are masters of these memetic hieroglyphs (indeed many of them are OG OT Ohmies). Don’t take our word for it, listen to Pavarotti bera Jala or Papa Fisk talking about the power of cults and memes (referencing the Olympus and Chainlink communities) from 33 mins 33 seconds in the inaugural episode of the Yunt Capital podcast: GoodWill Yunting: "What is Olympus DAO?" featuring Fiskantes and JaLa.
    Of course, we can’t forget about the (very convincing) argument that regardless of technical merit, CT bids ridiculous shit (APT, FTT, and OP being the flavors of the moment), and retail loves meme coins like the million different yet the same dog coins. Enter a coin called BERA. A coin for a chain with real technical use cases that is built by a team of bears smoking bongs. Can you imagine the smell on CT?
    “CT skipped to the cottage for a closer look. She knocked on the door and was disappointed when no one answered. Then it hit her—the most wonderful smell she had ever smelled! “BERA!” CT said dreamily as her stomach rumbled.”
    mckenna nos
    But calling Berachain only a meme with a fanatical cult following would be selling it very, very short. What about the aforementioned metanarratives that CT loves so much? Well anon, Berachain has got it all. Let’s look into all the technical innovations happening within Berachain.
    Cambrian Explosion of Berachain
    berry schlong
    “So many of these rotation plays where we hear about Vitalik chain one week,  Vitalik’sMom Chain and then Vitalik’sSchlong Chain the next week where it’s like you’re playing mad libs with protocols. Here’s my uni for xchain and balancer for metis and it’s great to fill voids but we also wanted protocols to have a reason to exist and be a part of sticky liquidity and drive value to their token holders. These situations where gov tokens are just down only and now maybe i’ll turn on this fee switch as part of this real yield narrative, and so many cases… ask not what you can do for your chain, but ask what your chain can do for you.” Smokey on Market Capping: MarketCapping - Interview #4 w/ Berachain Founders
    “Berachain's lore is the memetic Trojan Horse behind what will be DeFi's deepest and most productive liquidity pools.” - Smokey
    0x_d24 nos
    Berachain will be a vibrant L1, which is easy to access from the lucrative Ethereum mainnet. There will be bucket loads of utility from day one, including earning staking yields on your native bluechips (ETH, BTC, USDC, etc) paid out in sticky stables. From a protocols perspective, there will be yield directed to them from the security and block production of the chain itself which will align incentives of protocols, which they can pass on to their users. There are games for retail, protocols and perp funding for the arbooors. There is an AMM and Perps built into the chain itself. We could go on but we’re too stoned. We hope you've had enough of the Bong Water to get the picture and dive deeper into the Bera hole. We could expand on all the technical 0 to 1 innovations happening within Berachain but you should just check out these resources so we’re not spinning the same yarn. Consume all of these and you will have your Mad Honey Moment.

    2.

It is also equivalent to a Honeycomb in the Honey Gate raffle for free allocation in Gen 2 mint.*
    Henlo, please note everything written after this statement may, or may not be, psyops. This is written for education and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Most of this was written by Napzilla who has a lot of bear jpegs and edited by Janitooor who also has a lot of bear jpegs and is also a seed investor in Berachain. Remember anon, do your own psyops.*
    THJ is a cult, a ponzi, a scam
    The Honey Jar progressed from concept to reality very quickly, even for a crypto project. The janitooor’s ambitious idea started minting just 69 (+3) days after conception. Let’s give a quick recap of some of what occurred within those 2.5 months:

    Recruited and onboarded 20 team members

    All contracts written from scratch by GPT4.20

    Developed a highly interactive website complete with embedded swap capabilities and retro games

    10 articles written

    Broke mirror.xyz due to article demand

    Became a top selling collection on Optimism

    Raised >100 ETH by selling articles to a community with a high illiteracy rate

    Brought >1000 noberas into the bera community via the articles

    Recorded an audio version of Bonga Bera 101

    Numerous Twitter Spaces and Discord events by the THJ business development team

    Hosted the largest poker tournament in DeFi history, with over 900 players

    Produced a massive amount of creative work (art, PFPs, infographics, etc.)

    Recorded a three-part janitooor podcast with The Honey Cast (Parts 1, 2, and 3)

    Ran a Cult Contribution Competition that encouraged the community to create original works, building hype for THJ and the Berachain ecosystem

    Started a YouTube channel containing THJ content how-to videos

    Established a home base and massive presence in BeraLand Discord (which grew by 4x from 600 to 2700 from when THJ set up camp)

    Created multiple Dune dashboards providing never-before-seen insight into the bera world

    Translated articles into 20+ languages, establishing unprecedented accessibility paying translators fractionalised bit bears using partner platform caviar

    Helped grow unique bera jpeg holder count to over 1,000 for the first time ever

    Animated the Gen 1 process

    Gibbed 1 OG Bong Bear, 1 Bond Bear, 1 Boo Bear, 1 Baby Bear, 2 Band Bears, 36 Bit Bears and 26 Honeycomb cumulatively worth 160 ETH

    And that’s just the tip of the honeyberg. All of this was completed without a single all team meeting. TardFi take notes.
    Nothing draws a crowd quite like the beras
    So what was the outcome of all of that output? All 16,420 Honeycomb NFTs sold out in 2 weeks. 4,229 were claimed for free by those eligible for InfinityGate, BeraGate, PartnooorGate, and FrenGate. The members of those gates then minted an additional 5,359 NFTs before the public mint even began. And finally, the public minted the remaining 6,832 jpegs. The price for each Honeycomb was either 9.9 OHM or .099 ETH. Users were 5x more likely to mint using OHM. This makes sense considering that minting with OHM provided a discount of around 33%. But also the bera community has a long history with OHM, as was described in our Bonga Bera 101 article. All data above can be seen for yourself in THJ’s Honeycomb Mint Dashboard.
    Pre-Mint
    How was such a successful mint possible in a brutal bear market (during a literal bank run) and during the cursed week of ETH Denver, especially one that was targeted to a bera community of which only 1,000 unique people hold gud bear jpegs? It all started with marketing to build hype, which happens to be one of janitooor’s fortes. The niche bera micro celebrity took to Twitter in late December 2022 to tease a new project he was working on. Over the 2.5 months leading up to the mint, the purpose and goals of The Honey Jar started to solidify in the eyes of the community through tweets written in smol. As the team grew, so did the reach of THJ-related tweets, as everyone got the word out.
    Then came the articles, starting with janitooor’s think-piece “Berachain, Cults, and the Dawn of The Honey Jar,” in which he laid out an extremely bullish case for Berachain, and also teased what was to come with The Honey Jar. The following articles built from there, starting with an overview of Bong Bear lore, and then moving into specifics of the purpose, mechanics, flywheels, and use-cases of THJ. In addition to being informative, these articles were also mintable through mirror.xyz which created a game within the game. Those who were lucky enough to obtain a copy of every eligible article earned a guaranteed free Honeycomb mint (as well as free mints in upcoming 6 mints), while those who held any individual eligible article were able to participate in BeraGate.
    Next came the Cult Contribution Competition, where the community could create informative or entertaining works in the name of furthering The Honey Jar and Berachain. There were 6 categories: Animation, Infographics, Video, Audio, Writing, and Miscellaneous. The winner of each category, as voted by Honeycomb and Bit Bear holders, would win a free Honeycomb. This voting process exposed the community to the THJ governance process, perhaps similar to how the operation of a DAO could theoretically work in the future. Those 6 winners would then go head-to-head to win the overall grand prize: a Band Bear. Shout out to the winner @iamark3ting for his unhinged video investigating the THJ x Berachain conspiracy.

    Throughout the period leading up to the mint, the Business Development team members were putting in some serious work in different avenues. The most obvious being establishing partnerships with projects building on bera. By the time of the mint, the BD legends had established 33+ partnerships with some of the biggest names in the space, and have continued to raise that number post-mint. The Honey Jar partners will provide value back to holders in a variety of ways including airdrops, reduced fees on platforms, special in-game benefits, early access to testnets, and many more.**

    The BD team also hosted and were involved in many community and excitement-building activities. For weeks on end, it seemed as though FW, Umeshu, and Kalius were on different Twitter Spaces every day explaining the value of THJ to a new audience. They also hosted the largest poker game in DeFi history. The THJ-sponsored game attracted 1,000+ participants. So many that they broke the SocialPoker website that it was supposed to be hosted on, causing a bit of a mess. They also established a presence IRL through two physical galleries: Toronto’s Finest Valentines Day and NFTLA. The 1,728 (and growing!) noberas who own a Honeycomb NFT can be directly attributed to their efforts. And we can’t forget about the mythical OOGA BOOGA Event, kicking off the Honeycomb mint.
    Mint
    OOGA BOOGA BONGA BERAS
    As usual, FW was on the mic to host the OOGA BOOGA Ceremony on March 4th, 2023 to commemorate the hibernation of the Glitch OG Bong Bear and the opening of the Infinity and Bera Gates. The event was hosted in the official Berachain Discord and quickly hit the 300 member limit. FW screen shared as the Bong Bear was transferred into the smart contract, kicking off the opening of the Gates (with some minor delays due to technical issues). Within 10 minutes, all of the free Honeycombs allocated to Bera jpeg and THJ article holders were claimed. The beras proved, yet again, that they will ape into anything related to the bera ecosystem.
    A whole bunch of beras showed up to lend their oogas and their boogas
    From there, the next two Gates, PartnooorGate and FrenGate, opened 48 hours later. Many more Honeycombs were claimed for free, and those eligible for all the open Gates started to take advantage of their early access to the paid mint. By the time the public mint opened 24 hours later, 5,359 Honeycombs were already minted.
    The public mint progressed slowly and steadily. To encourage minting, THJ decided to raffle off Bong Bear collection jpegs to random Honeycomb minters. The lucky winners were chosen during The Carnival of Chaos, a THJ event hosted in the BeraLand Discord on March 15, 2023. During the Carnival, 10 bear jpegs winners were randomly selected.
    Carnival of Chaos
    Ultimately, all NFTs were minted out by March 18, 2023, two weeks after the first Gates were opened. Upon all the NFTs being minted, one of the Honeycomb fermented, waking up the Glitch Bear. The lucky holder of the fermented Honeycomb was 0x6851, who claimed his OG Bong Bear immediately - and on his birthday! Lucky bastard.
    Post-Mint
    To close out Generation 1 of The Honey Jar, THJ hosted The Fermentation on March 19th, 2023. During the event, many beras cheered the initial success of the Honeycomb mint. New OG holder 0x6851 was present and spoke about his stroke of luck. Many Oogas were had, as were many Boogas. Also, a Bond Bear was raffled off, because why not?

    **But of course, the closing out of the Honeycomb mint wasn’t even the end of the first chapter of the book of The Honey Jar. As described in BeraFi: Bong Bears x NFTFi, the beras love to put their jpegs to work for them.
    Caviar
    Before all were even minted, a Honeycomb pool was established on Caviar, becoming the second-largest pool on the protocol. It has since become the #1 pool by both TVL and volume.
    Honeycomb leading the charge along with Bit Bears, Milady, and Remilio - great company at the top
    Sudoswap
    Honeycomb is another ideal collection for sudoswap. All of the NFTs are exactly the same, so holders and aspiring holders can use the pools to easily buy and sell their Honeycomb.
    Strong volume
    Protecc
    Our friends at Protecc have provided their NFT market-making services to THJ, helping Honeycomb continue to succeed throughout NFTFi. They have been a key partner in ensuring thicc liquidity and easy transacting on Blur, Caviar and sudoswap. Here’s what Protecc have to say for themselves:
    "As a market maker, Protecc Labs plays a crucial role in improving the maturity of the market structure in the NFT ecosystem. Providing deep, resilient liquidity for Honey Combs on both on-chain AMM's like Caviar and Sudoswap, as well as orderbook-based marketplaces like OpenSea and Blur has allowed the collection to trade healthily. Strong liquidity is paramount in establishing efficient price discovery in any market. At Protecc Labs, we provide resilient liquidity, helping to reduce collection volatility and increase market efficiency by providing a consistent source of patient orders. This, in turn, helps to establish a more accurate representation of an NFT’s fair market value and contributes to a mature market environment."
    Dashboards
    The Honey Jar continues to build out a suite of Dune dashboards, courtesy of the unmatched tian7. Many of the dashboards have become top trending dashboards on Dune globally. We now provide data for: The Bong Bears and Rebases, Bera Ecosystem Projects, Honeycomb Mint Data, General Honeycomb Data, THJ Articles, BeraFi, and Apes vs. Bears (what could it mean?). More are being created every day to provide our community with the information that they need to succeed.
    What’s Next?
    With the Generation 1 mint complete, what is next for The Honey Jar. Well, Generation 2, of course! The next mint will open on 4/20/23 (blaze it) at 1620 PST in the beraland discord and will differ from the first generation in a few ways. First, the NFTs will not be Honeycomb, but rather Honey Jars. These jars will have rarity components, and many of them! Second, HoneyGate will open. This gate was not active for the first mint, since nobody held any Honeycomb NFTs yet. For Generation 2, HoneyGate will open at the same time as InfinityGate and BeraGate, to all Honeycomb holders. Two hours after IG, BG, HG opens PartnerGate and FrenGate will open with the same conditions as gen 1 mint. Lastly after 4 hours the mint will be open to the general public. There’s also something about a DAO? Idk might be psyops tho. I wouldn’t want to give all the alpha away! You’ll have to wait for the next article.
    P.s. gib free allocation! IG eligible people will be eligible for up to 2 free jars and about 10% of Honeycomb holders will receive a free jar allocation via a raffle system. If you collect all the latest article collectibles then you get 3 extra entries to the Honey Gate raffle system. If you already hold the OG 10 articles and additionally get the next 3 articles then you get the second free Jar.

    Henlo, please note everything written after this statement may, or may not be, psyops. This is written for education and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Most of this was written by Napzilla who has a lot of bear jpegs and edited by Janitooor who also has a lot of bear jpegs and is also a seed investor in Berachain. Remember anon, do your own psyops.
    HoneyBlitzing Campaign
    Everything that you have seen to date about Bong Bears and Berachain has been almost exclusively, organically originated from early supporters of the NFT collections. The marketing budget of the official team to date has been $0, outside of the cost of producing the art. As we highlighted in our BeraFi article and to put this into context, up until now there have been <1,000 holders of the Bong Bear NFTs, and probably <50 daily active users. Check out this dashboard to see the gradual growth of the bears. How the fuck has the Berachain team achieved such a scrappy and prolific marketing machine for free?
    Mastermind, letfcurve or midcurve?
    Is it luck or brilliance on the part of the Berachain team to recognize the enthusiasm of the community and step back and let them run free? Or has this situation only developed because they spent their marketing budget on play-doh for Smokey to consume? The truth is probably somewhere in between.
    We know janitooor’s thoughts on the matter
    Before we deep dive into how things have unfolded in Berachain land, let’s look into some of the popular narratives around growth hacking and business development (BD) that were circulating last cycle. Let’s start with a popular meme from Web2 Silicon Valley “growth hacking” culture.
    One of the stories from Web2, which Berachain’s guerilla approach bucks, is the idea of blitzscaling. According to a contribution to Messari by Jack Purdu about DAOs and Blitzscaling, this is a practice popularized by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.
    Blitzscaling is a strategy and set of techniques for driving and managing extremely rapid growth that prioritize speed over efficiency in an environment of uncertainty. Put another way, it’s an accelerant that allows your company to grow at a furious pace that knocks the competition out of the water.
    In the Messari article, Purdu asserts that DAOs should think about doing the same thing that traditional firms do. The concept boils down to: use a stack of cash from VCs to grow bigger and faster than any competitors can catch up to. Throw money at anything and everything and don’t worry about what catches on and what doesn’t - it’s a shock and awe campaign. On the surface it makes sense, but due to some of the particularities of DAOs, this hasn’t exactly played out. A big reason is due to how undiversified DAO treasuries have been (with a few key exceptions). This concept is analyzed in this thread from Bond Protocol, a protocol that helps projects and DAOs to diversify their treasury via more sustainable bonding mechanisms.
    Diversification - not a strong-suit of DAOs
    The problem for most DAOs is that the vast majority of their treasuries are denominated in their native governance token. This means that their operating budgets are severely impacted during bear markets, therefore making blitzscaling an unsustainable approach. For the most part, this is one of the reasons that there haven’t been many Web3 projects that have successfully executed blitzscaling.
    Outside of blitzscaling, what other growth strategies have Web3 organizations been implementing? We will look at two: Foundation grants and high emissions via farming incentives. Look at most any L1 and you’ll find one or both of these in action. Let’s look a little more closely at two networks that are comparable to Berachain:

    EVMOS - Another attempt at EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) x Cosmos)

    Optimism - An L2 that implements optimistic rollup technology, allowing the network to leverage the security properties of the underlying L1 but whilst being able to offer cheaper transactions to users.

    The Sad Tale of EVMOS
    Narrator: It doesn’t
    Above, we see a drastic chart that paints a clear picture of the EVMOS Total Value Locked (TVL). A new chain launches and offers very high rewards to people who deposit funds onto the chain, causing a huge spike in TVL. Anons with capital were heavily incentivized to deposit their liquidity to the chain in exchange for network tokens, often known as farming. You may have heard the phrase “farm and dump.” Well my friend, this image is that strategy visualized. Sometime around August, you can see exactly where the incentives stopped… and pop went the weasel. The users were done farming and then took a big ol dump. Mercenary capital - high-rollers with money willing to go wherever there are profits to be made - were done with their EVMOS farming rotation, and took their money and probably profits elsewhere.
    Around November there was another round of incentives, and we can observe the exact same cycle. In our article “Berachain, Cults, and the Dawn of The Honey Jar” we describe this phenomenon as PvP in a ghost town. Mercenary capital comes in and extracts all that they can out of a new ecosystem before leaving without a trace. This provides no real value to anyone but themselves, and truly hurts the chain by preventing organic growth and by creating bagholders out of those who entered the space with good intentions. The issue here isn’t necessarily that this game is played, the issue is that it is often the only game in town - hence PvP in Ghost Town.
    You can see these results reflected in the downonly action of the EVMOS governance token below:
    RIP in peace
    So to answer the question “How could EVMOS come back?” Well, let’s not worry ourselves with that, anon. We wouldn’t wanna hurt any feelings. Instead, let’s look at Optimism before speculating on Berachain a bit.
    The Optimism of Optimism
    As the Condom’s chart shows, a similar situation played out with Optimism. Farming incentives attracted capital and TVL went up. Then those incentives dried up and the farmers dumped, causing TVL to fall off hard.
    Optimism? More like Pessimism lol
    We’re not here to shit on Optimism. We know they have been performing relatively better these past few pamps. That’s the the point. For the most part, whenever farming incentives dry up we can see a massive cliff in TVL and daily active wallets. Perhaps one of the exceptions to this model has been Velodrome. To date, Velodrome has been one of the models that has fared remarkably well. In part, this is because they pass on all the rewards/grants which they got from Optimism in order to amplify the effects of their tokens. This adds to the flywheel rather than just being a cost that goes to early mercenary users who do not have aligned mid-to-long term incentives with either the project or the underlying L1. 
    Wot dem Optimistic Bears doing? Sounds like an oxymoron.
    The Velodrome model itself has been replicated enough times for us to see that the model itself is sound, as in many of those cases there have been no grant-boosted funds from a foundation or similar entity. But we can say in this specific case that grant funds did help to accelerate and amplify the effect. Can the substantial trading volume that The Honey Jar’s article collections have been bringing to Optimism be the ecosystem’s saving grace? Let’s just say we aren’t too optimistic.
    Colorful Velodrome dashboard - looks like something Smokey would love to eat
    Recap on The Fat BERA Thesis
    Let’s take a little detour back to one of our earlier articles. In “Berachain, Cults, and the Dawn of The Honey Jar,” janitooor proposed the Fat BERA Thesis as a more fitting thesis for the innovations happening within Berachain than either Joel Monegro’s 2016 “Fat Protocols” thesis (the majority of value created is captured by protocols, not apps) or Zee Primes’ 2023 “Fat App Thesis” (Most value accrues to an app (or a few apps) that provides a broad range of products). The Fat BERA Thesis asserts that “Protocols with endogenous apps (AMMs, perps, stables, borrow/lending) which capture value and share with exogenous protocols, apps, and the cult (other stakeholders) will dominate DeFi”. Let’s break this dense sentence out:

    Protocols with endogenous apps (AMMs, perps, stables, borrow/lending)

    Imagine if GMX, USDC/DAI/FRAX and AAVE were all built into the protocol itself (endogenous)

    which capture value and share with exogenous protocols, apps

    Imagine portions of fees from those protocol-owned (endogenous) apps were then shared with projects building on top of the chain (exogenous) such as all The Honey Jar’s partners

    and the cult (other stakeholders)

    Imagine portions of those rewards were shared with early adopters of these projects

    will dominate DeFi’

    Imagine the concept of sticky liquidity. Come for the farming, stay when you realize that it’s sustainable and there is more than just PvP knife fighting on the menu


    This is the essence of what Smokey means when he says that Berachain will be the home of “Sticky Liquidity.” Make sure to check out the above article to read about the analogy of Berachain as the 16th century Kingdom of Portugal.
    Not optimistic about Coinbase’s NFT volumes…
    But let's loop back around to Velodrome and Optimism. Imagine if Velodrome’s supplementary value flow came through activities at the base layer of Optimism rather than as a grant from the Foundation. Even with the latest news that Coinbase will be using Optimism as a base layer, Optimism will be beholden to Coinbases good will to pass on % of value through the platform to them…
    This is the heart of the Fat BERA Thesis: a model where portions of endogenous (base layer) app rewards flow through to the exogenous apps (Velodrome in this example) gaining traction on the baselayer, therefore amplifying both in a win-and-help-win flywheel that starts at the very core of the L1. Not only this, but this exogenous project would be getting diversified capital streams which would diversify their treasury or allow them to reward their users in diverse token flows. This all lays the foundations for a much wider diversity of games and aligned incentives - from day dot.
    Dysfunctional DeFi and the Rise of Berachain
    A new narrative for Treasury managment
    As Smokey F. Kennedy stated on MarketCapping: “Ask not what you can do for your chain, but ask what your chain can do for you.” Not only did he completely flip the original quote (typical Canadian), but what does it even mean? None of the following Berachain details have been publicly announced yet, so it is all prone to total change, but we can extrapolate and create something from non-existence to imagine what he MIGHT mean.
    We imagine a situation where the following is happening within the Berachain ecosystem:

    The L1 has some of the most popular types of applications at the protocol layer (swaps, a stablecoin, perps, etc.)

    Some proceeds from these apps flow to early supporters who are involved in governance, early app development, etc.

    This process allows apps to diversify their treasuries and allows some of that value to flow through to their users (think Optimism’s grant model)

    The culmination of all of this is STICKY, honey-like liquidity. But that’s not all! From day one, there will be a whole host of interesting dynamics, games, protocols, and projects for excited users to play with. It’s in this context that it starts to mek sense that big brains such as 0xSami_, Devon Bear have been attracted to contribute to Berachain. Berabullish.
    In fact, in the current prehistory of Berachain, we can already see the bera community’s degenerate tendencies coming through strong, as featured in THJ’s previous articles. Since we started writing these articles, Berachain-related projects have raised >$1M via premints, NFT drops, etc - and all before Berachain has released any public code, let alone a testnet.
    Be careful fading the beras, anon
    All of this is what we call HoneyBlitzing, or Operation Bear Hug. It turns the foundation grant and VC burn blitzscaling strategy on its head, and instead focuses on the age-old lessons of treating your early users like gold, prioritizing word of mouth, and letting the rest follow. It’s within this context that we can see what Smokey means when he says he is open sourcing the Berachain business development. In our opinion, this type of a business development approach has yet to be seen in our industry at the Layer 1 level and will chalk up yet another 0 to 1 innovation for the Beraverse. The play-doh eater may just be getting away with it.
    Operation Bear Hug is live
    To bring this all to a close, let’s look at the historical eras of innovation and growth in crypto and make a prediction of the next era:

    Bitcoin - Genesis of cryptocurrencies

    Color Coins - The OG Ordinals (look it up), time doesn’t repeat but it rhymes

    Bitcoin forks - Dogecoin is the OG here

    Ethereum - Launch of the premier degen L1

    ICOs - Ethereum was initially a platform for launching tokens via Initial Coin Offerings (probably 100% were securities)

    Food Coins - Coins like YAM and TENDIES are a prelude to DeFi Summer

    DeFi Summer - Explosion of DeFi protocols

    NFTs - The notorious boom of good (and bad) jpegs

    Fat BERA Era - The Bera Era is soon upon us and it’s got it all Food, DeFi, NFTs and more. All praise be to Berallah

    The truth is - nobody has seen what an ecosystem looks like when it launches with institutional capital, enough surface area for degens to degen, sticky liquidity for wider ecosystem benefits, and NFTs as the face of the space’s culture all from day one.
    Smokey v janitooor
    What we do know is that the Berachain rollout has not been blitzscaling, nor has it been foundation-incentivized farming (impossible in any case due to non-existence), but instead a third stranger thing - HoneyBlitzing. We may observe that some of the emergent properties in the bera space are similar to the early years of Burning Man or the types of situations described as Temporary Autonomous Zones by Hakim Bey. An effort that started with a focus on fundamentals and infrastructure turns into something completely different when the early freaks show up and make it their own. But in this case, these early bera freaks are able to utilize what we describe in our piece on Berachain and Cults as the The Holy Trinity of Crypto: (blockchains, wallets) + Cryptography (signing, encryption) + Digital Networks (the internet, digital media) propelling us across dimensions, fusing meatspace with cyberspace into cypherspace allowing the beras to do it on the internet instead of naked in the desert on six tabs of acid.

    4. Honey Jar Ponzinomics — The Honey JarSubscribeHoney Jar PonzinomicsThe Honey Jar0xE822February 28th, 2023MintThis is the Bit Bear equivalent article and is needed for BearGate and InfinityGate.
    Henlo, please note everything written after this statement may, or may not be, psyops. This is written for education and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Most of this was written by Napzilla who has a lot of bear jpegs and edited by Janitooor who also has a lot of bear jpegs and is also a seed investor in Berachain. Remember anon, do your own psyops.
    Over the years, we’ve seen thousands of essentially the same drop: 10k animal PFPs. Sometimes they’re koalas, sometimes they’re lions, sometimes they’re even manatees. But the art always looks similar, as do the traits (and the fact they have traits in the first place). Your duck has a crown and 3D glasses? Send it! Your moose only has a plain shirt with the project name on it? RIP to your 0.2 ETH, brother. The majority of these collections come and go. If a project is lucky, it will mint out. If it’s even luckier, it will survive the inevitable dump as 99% of minters realize this wasn’t the time they got lucky and scored a legendary (this won’t stop them from trying their luck at the next low-effort animal pfp mint, though). If it’s insanely lucky, it will actually find traction for some reason and go up in price. But at the end of the day, that’s the ceiling of what any of these projects can truly aspire for. And there’s nothing wrong with that! But in the depths of crypto twitter -  specifically the NFT subsector of CT - some degenerates aspire for more.
    It's just bears, but high AF
    So, what if there was a 10k animal PFP that did things differently? One that didn’t drop all 10,000 NFTs up front, but instead relied on some new flavor of ponzinomics to give itself a much higher chance of success. You may have guessed that I’m talking about the Bong Bears. In short, the initial NFT drop was a mere 107 beras. From there they have rebased and rebased, concluding with a grand total of 9,311 zooted bears (that’s not 10k, I know, we never said bears could count gud). The first rebasing NFT collection is slowly working its way towards becoming another 10k animal PFP. But the journey to that point has made all the difference.
    Unique bear holders over time - far from your average holder distribution!
    That’s not the only distinguishing feature of the Bong Bear NFTs. You may have also heard that the team behind the NFTs is also building a novel L1 to accompany the little ursine fellas and fellettes. We at The Honey Jar cannot confirm or deny if this mythical chain is actually being built (hint: it’s not), but if it were, you could read all about it and the many factors working in its favor in our first article, “Berachain, Cults, and the Dawn of The Honey Jar” (if you could read, which you can’t).
    Okay, okay, we’ve told you about all of this in pretty much all of our previous articles, so let’s get to the point. The word “ponzi” gets thrown around a lot in the crypto world, usually incorrectly. So we would like to continue this trend and discuss the ponzinomics of The Honey Jar. 
    As discussed in our “BeraFi: Bong Bears x NFTFi” article, the degenerate beras love to turn everything into a game. What started as an ambitious attempt to bring value to the bera community through high-quality, long-form articles discussing bera history and lore, the beneficial effects of Cult as a Service (CaaS), and the novel characteristics of The Honey Jar, quickly turned into yet another game for the beras to play. So why not run with it? The beras wanted a new game, The Honey Jar gave them one.
    The release of The Honey Jar’s first (very educational) article on the Web3 publishing platform mirror.xyz sparked an idea. Despite absolutely no stated incentives for reader’s to utilize mirror’s “collect” functionality, beras were collecting this “Henlo, World!” piece by the hundreds. This was not lost on The Honey Jar team, so we cooked up the idea of getting bears to read for a whitelist spot rather than perform time-consuming and meaningless tasks in a Discord. And so it continued with the release of the second article which was the public’s first long-form glimpse into the mind of legendary bera sweeper and The Honey Jar’s founder, janitooor - the first communication from him that wasn’t written in smol on the bird app. As more articles have been released, the vision crystallized: this much less grind-y version of whitelist gaming would work swimmingly with the Gate design which was already in the works. More on the Gates later.
    Staggered article release from scarce to plentiful, showing similar distribution patterns as with the rebasing bear jpegs. There are now almost double the number of article holders as there are bear jpeg holders
    But before we get into the core ponzinomics of The Honey Jar, let’s look a little deeper into the first-of-its-kind article collection game. This article that you're reading is the Bit Bear equivalent. What the hell does that mean? Simply put, it’s The Honey Jar’s way of paying homage to the Bong Bear’s rebasing functionality that has enabled the amazing journey to where we are now. Each article that we have released mirrors the Bong Bears and their rebases in total collectible supply. The genesis article had 107 editions available for mint, just like the 107 OG Bong Bears. Side note: the bears managed to completely crash mirror while apeing into this mint. Bears gonna bear. The second article had 126 editions like the Bond Bears. And so on and so forth up to the final upcoming “HoneyBlitzing: Blitzscaling Berachain” with 4,713 copies, just like the much-awaited final bera rebase.
    The articles can be viewed in four ways:


    Good articles that are worth learning to read for


    Entry to early mint, what is commonly referred to as whitelist or allowlist


    A potential chance for some free mints


    In the case of InfinityGate, a pretty sure-fire way of securing a free mint


    The collection of educational articles was not a planned facet of The Honey Jar’s ponzinomics, but as you’ll discover as you learn more about this innovative gateway to DeFi, once the flywheel starts turning, it is impossible to stop.
    Many noberas have been able to enter the ecosystem
    Before moving on, we need to introduce the Gate system. The Honey Jar has iterated on the AirLock design created by the Apeliens Larvae NFT project. In their design, the AirLock was a way to supply partner communities with passwords to AirLocks ahead of general mint, which would allow these communities to get early access to minting before it became open to the general public. The Honey Jar has adapted this design into the notion of Gates, a 0 to 1 innovation in the NFT space which opens a whitelist in phases to people who meet certain on-chain requirements. The reason for this is three fold:


    The purpose of Honeycomb is for it to be distributed to as wide of a set of supporters as possible. Gates make it easier to distribute 40% of supply to new entrants who have a chance to get into the system for cheap or free


    Staggering access to the mint introduces both elements of FOMO and elements of order, which will hopefully make the process less taxing on people’s time, emotions, and gas


    Deciphering how the ponzu design works, and what path through the forest a degen will take is a high signal of Proof of Active Participation. More on why this is valuable later


    To read more about exactly what conditions are involved for each Gate, read The Honey Jar FAQs (another collectible ;) ).
    High-level view of the various Gates
    But, where were we? Oh yes, bears reading, a very rare occurrence indeed. The articles fit very nicely into this Gate system as they allow for the design of a new set of on-chain conditions which the gates can utelise. If someone is just interested in securing access to early mint - cool, you can do this for 15 bucks by collecting one of the 10k supply articles. No Discord hustle needed. If you want to maximize your free claims, then you may read all the articles, decipher the ponzu, and ask questions on twitter or Discord. You may collect all the articles and turn up early to the right Gate and jump in to claim your scare-free claim allocation. And finally, we would be remiss not to cover the degenerate sect of the beras - the speculatooors. By replicating the Bong Bear distribution model, the Beanie Baby Effect is triggered for those interested in engaging in the scarcity speculation game. Those who collect one of each article are eligible for InfinityGate, the most assured way to successfully mint one of The Honey Jar’s Honeycomb NFTs. A maximum of 107 (the supply of the most scarce THJ article) users are guaranteed a Honeycomb through InfinityGate for each generation of Honeycomb NFTs, as long as they mint it before the general mint sells out. 
    Look at all those glorious articles
    The game doesn’t stop with InfinityGate, though. Collecting any of the rebase-equivalent articles also qualifies all holders for a free Honeycomb claim via BearGate. BearGate was intended to be the Gate where Bong Bear and rebase holders were able to access a number of free claims, hence the name. But once the fun got started with the article gamification, the THJ team decided that it would be nice to reward the literate portion of the community as well, giving better opportunities to noberas who have been dutifully engaged in better understanding the Beraverse. As we have noted in past articles, Honeycomb NFTs are meant to be a less expensive gateway into exposure to the Berachain ecosystem. The bera jpegs are good jpegs, but they are also expensive. Opening BeraGate to holders of eligible articles offers another cost-effective way to bring new frens into the bera fun.
    To illustrate the success that this article game has already had, we can look no further than the Optimism NFT dashboard. Huge spikes in volume occurred as the bera community aped into the articles.
    See those big candles? Those are the bera candles
    But WHY do all this? Because it’s a fun way to gamify the whitelisting process without the tedious, dehumanizing grind that other projects force potential community members to endure. The Honey Jar intends to be a project that builds up the community, not one that discourages folks from getting excited and involved. In fact, we even have a campaign that is live through March 5th, that incentivizes community contribution. This campaign does not simply reward creators with whitelist spots, because that would be lame. The users who create the 6 best pieces of content in various categories will each win a Honeycomb NFT, with the grand champion winning a Band Bear! See the linked tweet and below image for more details on how to participate.
    The Honey Jar’s campaign infographic
    We at The Honey Jar truly believe that all these articles we have been writing are important.
    Not just for self-promotion purposes either. Bonga Bera 101 was written with the intention of bringing new entrants up to speed on literally everything that has occurred with the blazed bera NFTs since day one. The Berachain and Cults article was written with the intention of helping people to open their eyes to the upside of getting involved with what will eventually become Berachain. The BeraFi article was written with the intention of cultivating a greater understanding of the future of NFTFi and why we believe it will be a huge component in the future of France. We think that those who understand the history of this space and what is expected to come in the near future will have a huge advantage. We want those who care enough to spend their time learning with us to reap the benefits of their expanded knowledge.
    So naturally, we turned the process of getting involved with educating the community into another game. We would love for these articles to be as accessible as possible to everyone. So we have been funding translations of these very articles. There are currently volunteers working on translating our works into 25+ languages. If their work is quality - not just running the article through Google translate and calling it a day - these ambitious folks are being paid out for their hard work in fractionalized Bit Bears using Honey Jar partner Caviar. We have developed a way for people to get actual bong bear NFTs without having to spend a penny. And we hope that while they are carefully reading through all of our articles as they translate them, they are becoming just as bought-in and bullish (berapilled) as we have become while writing them. We have gamified education again, like a Web3 Reading Blaster.
    If only more beras had played Reading Blaster as cubs
    But enough about the articles that you are unable to read anyway. Let’s get into the ponzinomics of The Honey Jar itself. As noted, a sizeable percentage of the mint will be available early to established community members and partners through InfinityGate, BeraGate, PartnooorGate, and FrenGate. 40% of the total NFT supply will be free to those who have supported us and the broader Berachain ecosystem in one way or another. What other project has just given away a large percentage of their collection to their frens? This leaves 60% for the general public to attain. Those who were previously not involved in anything bera, along with the missooors, will have their chance to obtain Honeycomb and prove their active engagement with the Berachain ecosystem and thus position themselves for all the benefits that may come along with that.
    At its core, each Honeycomb NFT is what we call a bearified POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol - or our version, Proof of Active Participation). Until now, most POAPs have not been very useful. Many projects use them as a simple way for their community members to have proof that they were in attendance at notable project events. But after their POAP NFTs have been minted, they generally just sit in holder wallets collecting dust. You may be detecting a pattern by now - The Honey Jar has gamified this concept.
    Always has been
    When you collect a Honeycomb, you have NFT proof that you have actively participated in one of the following:


    Decoded and gained an understanding of the ultimate design of The Honey Jar


    Educated yourself on bera lore, history, data, NFTFi, ponzinomics, etc.


    Introduced yourself to the Bong Bears and Berachain


    Learned about novel rebasing mechanics that have been mimicked with our articles


    Aped into a berachain thing and you don’t know why but you’re good at sniffing honey on the wind


    The ultimate outcome is that our identification of active participants gives The Honey Jar’s partnooors an engaged and interested audience that is available to be targeted for their own purposes, whatever they may be. And all without the need for the whitelist hustle culture that was cultivated over previous crypto market cycles. Project teams can spend their valuable time actually working on their product, instead of organizing and facilitating tedious Discord events to identify those in their community who “want it” the most. Aspiring or current community members don’t have to spend their days grinding for precious whitelist spots. It’s a big win for everyone involved.
    At this time, it’s worth noting that absolutely zero Honeycomb have been set aside for VCs, industry insidooors, and The Honey Jar team. This sets the stage for a fair distribution where reluctant minters can be more confident that if they take their chances and get their paws on a Honeycomb, they won’t get immediately dumped on by unknown actors. Overall, if you believe that our partners are real, the fake chain will eventually be real, and that the various stakeholders involved in THJ will make good on their promises, then we hope that the risk of spending your hard earned money on our NFTs will be worth the potential rewards. If nothing else, they are very good articles and jpegs.
    To be clear, at the time of the mint in early March, there will still be quite a bit of mystery surrounding the Honeycombs. We can say that they are good jpegs, but not much more. And we can say that 7 is the number of rebases of Bong Bears and the number of Honey Jar articles. The entire goal of The Honey Jar project has been to create something in support of the Berachain ecosystem. Holding a good Honeycomb picture shows that you are a supportive community member who has engaged with the bera world in the past, and would like further exposure in the future. Everything that this team has built has been with that specific goal in mind. Flywheels have been implemented, new ways to obtain free claims have been invented, but the objective has stayed the same. Ultimately, the choice is yours. Whether you choose to purchase a Honeycomb or not, at least our articles have given you a reason to learn how to read.

    The State of Bong Bears

    The Bong Bears and their rebases are a group of NFT collections that sit at the intersection of NFTs and DeFi. We at The Honey Jar were interested in the growth of these collections, so we broke down the on-chain data to see how the bera ecosystem has evolved since its launch in August 2021.
    In this article, we will:


    Break down the major trends in secondary market trading


    Investigate the size of the Bear over-the-counter (OTC) market


    Present an overview of the Bera holderbase


    Discuss the future of the bears


    Secondary Market Trading
    The beras have done over $12.6M of trading volume on secondary markets such as OpenSea and Blur. This puts the beras in the top 10% percentile of NFT collections by total secondary market volume.
    April 2022 was the all-time high for Opensea trading with $2.8M of secondary market volume. Over the past three months, the bears have seen consistent growth in volume, putting them on-track to return to all-time high levels.
    Bear secondary market volume over time
    As of February 2023, Blur has become the leading marketplace for bera trading with 38% marketshare. Sudoswap comes second with 35% marketshare, and OpenSea is third with 25.5%.
    Sudoswap OTC volume
    It’s surprising that Sudoswap sits so high in the bera trading ranking because Sudoswap only has 0.6% marketshare of the total NFT secondary market.
    This gap between the behavior of bera traders and the wider NFT market stems from the Bong Bears’ unique origin story. Unlike most NFT collections, the founders and initial Bong Bear community were deeply rooted in DeFi. You can read our Bonga Bera 101 article to get the full history of how the beras first emerged from the depths of DeFi.
    The AMM mechanics of Sudoswap, which are unfamiliar to most NFT traders, are comfy for DeFi-native bera holders. As a result, Bera holders are significantly more likely than the average NFT trader to provide liquidity on Sudoswap and thereby facilitate trades there.
    The most sophisticated bera LPs have been seeing strong returns. For example, the top Bit Bear pool on Sudoswap has earned 18.7 ETH in fees since it was created in November 2022.
    Currently, Bit Bears are the most actively traded tier of the bera family. In February 2023, 69% of the bera trading volume on secondary markets was from Bit Bears.
    Bear secondary market volume by collection
    81% of the bera trades were Bit Bear trades. It makes sense that the bera tier with the highest supply and lowest floor price is the most liquid.
    Bear secondary market sales by collection
    OTC Trading
    Over-the-counter (OTC) trades are negotiated privately between individual bera holders instead of going through a marketplace.
    We’re currently tracking two OTC trading methods to estimate the size of the bera OTC market:


    Direct Bear-for-ETH OTC: Instances where one wallet transferred bears to another wallet and received ETH from that wallet on the same day


    Sudoswap OTC: Trades that take place using Sudoswap’s legacy OTC tool


    In both cases, we don’t track OTC activity on the original Bong Bear collection. The fact that original Bong Bears live on the OpenSea Shared Storefront contract make them difficult to track via on-chain analysis.
    Direct Bear-for-Eth OTC
    We estimate that 251 ETH has been spent on direct Bear-for-ETH OTC, and that 211 bears have traded hands this way.
    Direct Bear-for-ETH OTC volume
    Sudoswap OTC
    Sudoswap OTC is a much more popular method for OTC trades. Using the protocol is much safer than sending somebody your bears and trusting that they pay the agreed amount or vice versa. 1,083ETH has been spent on Sudoswap OTC, and 299 bears have traded hands this way.
    Direct Bear-for-ETH OTC volume
    Holders
    The bera holderbase is designed to grow consistently over time as the existing NFTs rebase into larger and more accessible collections. As we can see in the chart below, when each new rebase is minted we see a positive step change in the bera holderbase.
    Unique Bear Holders
    For most NFT projects, this isn’t the case. They usually achieve peak distribution soon after their mint, and then the supply consolidates over time into a smaller number of strong hands (if it’s a successful collection) or bag-holders (if it’s a weak collection).
    Having consistent holder growth is good for continuously introducing more capital and value-add participants to the bera ecosystem. The Bong Bears’ rebasing mechanism continuously rewards early holders and is great for aligning incentives. After most NFT mints, minters are immediately planning their exit strategy. With beras, you find holders who have much longer time horizons for staying in the community and contributing by spreading the word or building (*cough The Honey Jar cough*) to ensure that their future rebases will be even more valuable and liquid.
    What’s next?
    It’s been a crazy year and a half for the bera clan. The future is shaping up to be even crazier as we anticipate the final rebase (what will it be??), the launch of the highly anticipated Berachain, and the glorious March of the Beras.
    We expect that:

    Secondary market liquidity will concentrate around the newer rebases while the higher-tier bears are held long-term by strong hands

    The bears will lead the way with experimentation on the cutting edge of NFT finance (NFTFi)

    The bera holderbase continues to expand in a way that’s beneficial to the network.

    We’re excited to be on this journey with you. Can’t wait for what comes next 🐻✨Subscribe to The Honey JarReceive the latest updates directly to your inbox.

    6. The Honey Jar 101 — The Honey JarSubscribeThe Honey Jar 101The Honey Jar0xE822February 15th, 2023MintThis is the Bond Bear equivalent article and is needed for BearGate and InfinityGate.
    Henlo, please note everything written after this statement may, or may not be, psyops. This is written for education and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Most of this was written by Napzilla who has a lot of bear jpegs and edited by Janitooor who also has a lot of bear jpegs and is also a seed investor in Berachain. Remember anon, do your own psyops.
    Every so often, an NFT project comes along and changes everything. In the earlier days of Ethereum, CryptoPunks kicked off the demand for jpegs on the blockchain. Later came SuperRare and Art Blocks for more curated collections. And we all know about the apes from Bored Ape Yacht Club, helping to evolve NFTs from a niche market for crypto degens into a worldwide phenomenon with A-list celebrities buying in (and getting hacked and losing their apes in increasingly novel ways).
    You may have seen this timeline of early NFT history floating around Twitter
    Then came our beloved Bong Bears. The first rebasing NFT collection that rewards holders with more NFTs every few weeks - or months. Also, the first NFT project to branch out from the jpeg game to create a whole new L1 blockchain. Berachain is coming soon (maybe), and will have a whole slew of things to do within its ecosystem once it launches. A large part of this is due to its roots in the game dynamics and ponzus of DeFi and NFTFi. Not to mention an absurd, raucous cult of supporters ready to do its bidding. For an in-depth analysis of why the combination of these things will bring a prosperous result, read our article “Berachain, Cults, and the Dawn of The Honey Jar.” Indeed the stage is set for Bong Bears becoming the first NFT collection to break out of the confines of its origins (mainstream towards DeFi or DeFi towards mainstream). We’ll be digging into this in our upcoming “BeraFi: Bong Bear x NFTFi'' article.
    Even with all of the innovation in NFTs over the past few years, most projects tend to stay in their own distinct lane. Sure, projects occasionally collaborate and unite communities, but generally a team focuses on their own specific product and community. And for some projects, this has worked! If we have learned anything from some of the most successful NFTs, it is that building a strong community of believers and delivering for them is the most surefire way to be prosperous in the short to medium term. But where does a successful team go from there? Delivering new derivative works and project-specific utility can only go so far. Eventually the magic can wear off and returns can diminish.
    For longer term success, perhaps projects should align their incentives with the overall success of the ecosystem that they are building in. Enter The Honey Jar.
    What is The Honey Jar?
    Glitch in the jar
    There are so many things happening at all times within the crypto world. Even if you are active on CT and follow thousands of people, there will still be large projects with thousands of followers that you miss completely. Have you wished you could hire your own personal intern (or maybe GPT4.20 model) who could spend all day researching and grinding whitelists for quality up-and-coming projects? Have you ever been a project founder looking to summon a magical elf that could curate a list of high-quality engaged community members? So when you release your token or NFT, your airdrop would yield the most bang for your buck, and avoid getting farmed and dumped to zero. Have you been an L1 wanting to build a deranged and loyal fan base without spending a single satoshi on marketing (which coincidentally is The Berachain Foundation’s marketing expenditure to date)? Well anon, The Honey Jar may well be the thing you have been wishing for.
    The Honey Jar is an unofficial community NFT project, situated at the heart of the Berachain ecosystem, which hosts a number of games. When we say games, we mean them in the sense of meta metagame as outlined in our earlier piece as well as games in the traditional sense. The lore draws influence from the Bong Bears and the wider Berachain ecosystem. It is built by the beras for the beras. Ooga booga.
    A lil mad honey side quest
    Video stills of Janitor having vision about The Honey Jar
    Before we go on, a side quest. The bear market has been rocky anon, well done for making it this far. Come in, take off your cloak, put your feet up by the fire and have a goblet of Honey Mead and let us tell you a tale. On the Winter Solstice - December 21, 2022, whilst deep in the forests of Witch country, the ancestral lands of Rumpelstiltskin, the idea for The Honey Jar struck Janitor like a full-body vision, as if having eaten a heroic dose of Mad Honey. He saw the image of Glitch Bear disappearing into a cave and being slowly enveloped by Honeycomb made of code. Only once the last piece of Honeycomb snapped into place did Spring arrive and Glitch Bear awakened. Glitch, ravenous after his hibernation, then made his way to eat some honeycomb. A piece of honeycomb had fermented, becoming Mad Honey. “Oh, Henlo, and furthermore, Ooga Booga '' said Glitch to himself. “This must be the most Special Honeycomb in all the Land '' as he proceeded to break his winter fast on this food of the gods. And so it was that Glitch, in cult-like religious ecstasy embarked on his next adventure, with new frens.
    We do love a twin, an oddity, a jester
    Whilst clearly a hallucination of an astrological bent, the seeds for this delusion were sown over a year earlier in November 2021, when Janitooor swept the infamous Glitch bera from the floor. Even back then, Glitch was envisioned as someday being a bear of the people. At first, the plan was to send Glitch into the world's largest Gnosis Safe (which ended up proving impractical) but the universe had much bigger plans for him. We do love a twin, an oddity, a jester. It could be said that the fate of Glitch was etched into the blockchain the moment Smokey, Shaman of Bera Shenanigans - our very own Loki, high as a kite, “accidentally” inscribed #84 as a duplicate in August of 2021, as if to say “Ooga Booga fren, your fate is sealed - let the chaos proceed”. The Honey Jar is the ultimate realization of the spirit of the Genesis of Glitch in his Hero’s Journey.
    Nick Furry Cooking up Summit
    As if possessed by the Archetype of Mother Bear (with all her strength, introspection and the power of the death/rebirth cycle), Janitor den transformed into Nick Furry and over the next few days assembled a crack squad of the best of the best from the bera universe.
    “There was an idea, @FWCrypto_ knows this, called the @0xhoneyjar. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, to see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to to fight the battles that we never could.”
    Everything you have read about The Honey Jar and everything which has been produced, has been pulled together by this crack squad since December 21, 2022 (with alotta help from GPT4.20). And they’ll be ready to launch The Honey Jar on a meme date, sometime thooon, on an internet connection near you.
    Technically speaking, what is The Honey Jar?
    Now, where were we? Technically speaking, The Honey Jar is made up of a number of immutable smart contracts initially hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, as it’s technically quite difficult to launch on a non-existent chain. It also has a website, hosted on the world wide web, which anons can use to interface with the games and contracts.
    The NFT itself is called Honeycomb. It is an ERC-721 token which is created by the smart contract once it has been supplied with an OG Bong Bear. The mechanics of the mint and the utility of the NFT will be discussed in detail below.
    The Honey Jar will run games in Seasons. Each game will create a new generation of mintable Honeycomb. Each mint will begin with the Hibernation of an OG Bong Bear (with more gud jpegs coming thooon). Honeycombs will be able to be used to vote within The Honey Jar system (more on this in a later article) and to get access to free claims in subsequent Hibernation games (more on this below).
    We like to call The Honey Jar a call option on the Berachain ecosystem. What does this mean? To put it simply, it is the easiest way for entrants to gain exposure to the full breadth of the projects and protocols building on Berachain. That being said, if you can afford a bear, they really are very good jpegs.
    Gib Honeycomb
    Why is this Important?
    As noted earlier, the normal NFT project paradigm consists of a team building and delivering for their specific project community. The Honey Jar flips this model on its head by providing benefits not only to those who hold the NFT, but also to a large percentage of projects building on Berachain… and even Berachain itself. But what do we mean by benefits?
    For NFT Holders: The Honey Jar aggregates perks from many projects building within the ecosystem, and provides them to the Honeycomb holders. It gives anons a relatively inexpensive way to gain exposure to much of what is being built on Berachain, all without having to do excessive research into dozens of projects. It’s like having a dedicated BD team working for you, maximizing your value.
    For Bera Projects: The Honey Jar aims to solve the age-old problem of identifying wallet addresses connected to degens who are actively engaged in the ecosystem, rather than giving airdrops to CT replyguys who are not actually invested in or aligned with the success of your project. This provides projects with an audience to target for potential airdrops, discounts, whitelists, early access, and anything else they can dream up. Honeycomb holders will be a much larger and decentralized group to work with, as opposed to the lucky few who hold the gud bera jpegs (though we’re working hard to mek sure The Honey Jar is a bery gud thing for Bong Bear OGs too).
    For Berachain: The Honey Jar has been built from scratch to show the power of the bera community. By bringing new entrants into the bera community, the strength of Cult as a Service (Attention as a Service) grows. Who needs a marketing budget when there are thousands of degenerates willing to do the marketing for you?
    The average NFT utility isn’t particularly impressive. Some allow holders to stake their NFTs to earn yield. Some provide fee reduction on a single DeFi protocol. But buying 20 different NFTs to get 20 different benefits can get tedious… and expensive. Wouldn’t it be much better to buy one NFT and receive benefits from many different projects and protocols? With The Honey Jar, Honeycomb holders will have a whole host of perks available to them, courtesy of our partnooors.
    Here are just a few potential (and definitely not real) benefits to Honeycomb holders:
    Earn extra yield from vaults

    Receive reduction in fees from swap protocols

    Access special items in NFT games

    Have extra votes in protocol governance

    Receive increased referral incentives

    Collect free NFT mints

    And that’s just the tip of the hypothetical honeyberg!
    What Games are There?
    We mentioned that there will be games. There are two main types of games hosted by The Honey Jar.
    Llamas x beras stronk

    Retro Games

    These can be found on the website. Do bears like easter eggs too?

    Winners of these games within set time periods will win spots on the PartnooorGate free claim lists when the next Hibernation Honeycomb Generation event happens

    The Honey Jar is willing to host minigame versions of any of our partner projects games

    Hibernation Games

    A Hibernation game begins when the Head Beekeeper supplies the Honey Jar with an OG Bong Bear (support for more gud jpegs thooon). The Bong Bear enters The Honey Jar Cave and begins its hibernation. This act of hibernation triggers the creation of a new generation of Honeycomb NFTs

    A limited number of Honeycomb NFTs are available for free claim by eligible wallets, and the rest for purchase by general mint

    Once all Honeycomb have been minted, Spring will begin and one of the Honeycomb will undergo magic fermentation to become Special Honeycomb which can wake up the OG Bear from its slumber. Once the Special Honeycomb is used to claim, the OG Bong Bear will then live in this anon’s wallet

    If Honeycomb never sells out, then the OG Bong Bear will forever slumber in the Honey Jar Cave. The contracts, and thus the cave, are immutable

    How Can I Get Honeycomb?
    There are three ways to get your grubby little paws on Honeycomb:

    Free claim and Early mint (this is just early access to General mint)

    General mint

    Secondary markets

    The Honeycomb available through each of these avenues are the same. There are no tiers to Honeycomb. All are equal in the eyes of The Honey Jar.

    Free Claim and Early Mint:

    The Honey Jar has iterated on the AirLock design created by the Apeliens Larvae NFT project. In their design, the AirLock was a way to supply partner communities with passwords to AirLocks ahead of general mint, which would allow these communities to get early access to minting before it became open to the general public. The Honey Jar has introduced the notion of gates, a 0 to 1 innovation in the NFT space, which are allowlisted with the following logic. Here are the ways you can be eligible to claim free Honeycomb:

    The InfinityGate (IG)

    A wallet is eligible for one Honeycomb if it holds one of each of the digital collectible versions of each of the articles which have been released at time of game initiation.

    This is the only gate which is not first come, first serve but must be claimed before General Mint mints out else the free claim will become mintable as part of the General Mint

    The InfinityGate will be the first gate which opens (along with BearGate), and will be open for 24 hours before the FrenGate and the PartnooorGate opens

    Eligible wallets will have access to the free claim as well as early mint (this is just early access to General mint)

    Those who meet InfinityGate criteria will also be eligible for BearGate and FrenGate.

    InfinityGate

    The BearGate (BG)

    A wallet is eligible for one Honeycomb per rebase of the Bong Bear collection that is in the wallet

    A wallet is eligible for one Honeycomb per digital collectible of any of the Bong Bear equivalent 0xHoneyJar articles contained in the wallet

    The BearGate will be the first gate which opens (along with InfinityGate), and will be open for 24 hours before The HoneyGate opens

    Eligible wallets will have access to the free claim as well as early mint (this is just early access to General mint)

    BearGate

    The HoneyGate (HG)

    A wallet is eligible for each type of Honeycomb held in the wallet. Each generation of Honeycomb is considered a type

    The HoneyGate will be the second gate which opens (after IG and BG) and will be open for 24 hours before the FrenGate and the PartnooorGate opens

    Eligible wallets will have access to the free claim as well as early mint (this is just early access to General mint)

    HoneyGate

    The FrenGate (FG)

    A wallet is eligible for one honeycomb for each type of token or NFT listed in the frens list

    Frens list is a single commingled bucket of allocation so all tokens and NFTs are competing with each other

    The FrenGate will open at the end of the HoneyGate period, and will be open for 24 hours before general mint

    Eligible wallets will have access to the free claim as well as early mint (this is just early access to General mint)

    FrenGate

    The PartnooorGate (PG)

    The Honey Jar partners with projects, protocols, and their communities. Each partnooor may supply an allowlist of wallets which will be eligible for free claims

    Each partner free claim allocation is non-competitive with other partners. Only those listed on a partner allowlist can access those allocated free claims

    A wallet is eligible for one honeycomb for each partner allowlist they are registered on

    Winners of The Honey Jar retro games will be added to a bucket of free claims as part of PartnooorGate

    The PartnooorGate will open at the end of the HoneyGate period and will be open for 24 hours before general mint

    Eligible wallets will have access to the free claim as well as early mint (this is just early access to General mint)

    PartnooorGate
    ***Free Claim Limits:***The following limits will be published at the beginning of a Hibernation game:

    The maximum Honeycomb that a wallet can claim per Gate

    The minimum holding of tokens listed on the FrenGate list to be eligible for The FrenGate

    When are Snapshots Taken?
    A snapshot will be taken at the beginning of each Hibernation game
    First Come, First ServedEach free claim gate will be on a strict first come, first served basis (except for InfinityGate). This means that you may be WL (on the allowlist) but it does not assure you will get a free claim. Being on WL does assure that you have access to early mint before the public opening of General Mint.
    Which NFTs and tokens are on the Frens list?
    You should check the website and docs before launch or in the meantime you can propose a project (and see the current list) here.
    How many Hibernation Games do you plan to run through The Honey Jar?
    Assuming the first Season of The Honey Jar is successful we plan to run Seasons until there is no longer support from the community. We have some familiar dynamics from DeFi which we will be applying into this NFTGamu experience which we think will make for an interesting experiment.
    ***Will the rules be the same for future games?
    ***Whilst we reserve the right to update the Gate and allowlist logic, at this moment in time - yes. The rules will be the same.
    What is the schedule for the article digital collectibles?
    Schedule for article release and 1620 region
    2.General Mint:
    General mint will cost 9.9 OHM or 0.099 ETH. There is no limit on the number of Honeycomb a wallet can purchase through this mint.
    General mint opens 72 hours after the BearGate and InfinityGate opens, and 48 hours after the HoneyGate Opens and 24 hours after FrensGate and PartnooorGate opens. When the general mint bucket is exhausted, it will start to draw from any of the free claim buckets that still have available Honeycomb like a Bera Ouroboros.
    3.Secondary Markets:
    Anyone is free to set up a secondary market at any point. In addition, The Honey Jar team may set up liquidity via services such as Caviar, Sudoswap, and Llamalend to offer liquidity for Honeycomb. Partners may also set up pools.
    Partnooorships
    A foundational principle of The Honey Jar is to be a win and help win flywheel that maximizes benefits to each stakeholder in the Berachain ecosystem: the Honeycomb holders, Bong Bear holders, the projects building on Berachain and Berachain itself. Details and alfa will leak over the coming days, but at the time of writing, The Honey Jar is aiming for 33 partnerships for launch and has secured the following partnooorships:

    More partnooorships are expected to be forged in the coming days. The benefits which Honeycomb holders will receive will be the topic of an upcoming article. With the success of The Honey Jar comes the success of our frens. As they say, a rising tide lifts all boats. Or perhaps, rising honey lifts all beras.
    Allocations and the Future of France
    The initial Hibernation Honeycomb Generation event will allocate Honeycomb in the following way:
    Please note that these figures should be considered tentative and may change. Check the official documentation when the project launches for the finalized numbers.
    The Honey Jar has no VCs, no team allocation, and no honoraries (fuck off bearyphus and bearmo). There is also a cap on free claims per wallet to limit the power of Bera Whales. The purpose of this approach is to achieve the widest and most decentralized distribution of Honeycomb NFTs to the Bera Cult as possible. In doing so, Honeycomb could become the most financially accessible way to gain exposure to the Berachain ecosystem.
    Attestations of Smart Contracts
    Smart Contract Details:
    The smart contracts powering The Honey Jar have been written by GPT4.20. Some titans of the industry are peer reviewing the contracts and will make the following attestations:

    The smart contract is immutable

    Honeycomb NFTs can only be generated once the contract is supplied with an OG Bong Bear ERC-1155 token

    Honeycomb NFT is given to a degen as soon as they mint (either by free claim, early mint or general mint)

    The random selection of the Honeycomb which can be used to wake up the OG Bear uses ChainLink Oracle to ensure verifiable randomness

    There is no way for anyone, including the team, to remove the OG Bear from the cave other than through random honeycomb selection. The team cannot rug pull

    There is no way for the team to pre-mint Honeycomb Admins can remove revenue from early or general minting at any time

    Wen Launch?
    Thooooon. The Honey Jar’s first hibernation mint gamu will launch in 3-4 weeks pending contract reviews on a gud meme date. We will be launching from within the Berachain Community Discord, where we will be doing a live screen share of Glitch Bear being sent into the smart contract cave, potentially for forever, to initiate the opening of InfinityGate and BearGate for Season 1 of The Honey Jar. We hope you will join us in chanting “Ooga Booga and Safe Travels” to wish Glitch a safe hibernation and good luck on the next chapters of his adventure!
    If none of this made any sense to you, we recommend you catch up on Bong Bears 101 and our longer piece called Berachain, Cults and the Dawn of The Honey Jar. Ooga Booga.

    7. Bonga Bera 101 — The Honey JarSubscribeBonga Bera 101The Honey Jar0xE822February 6th, 2023MintThis is the Bong Bear OG equivalent article and is needed for BearGate and InfinityGate.

    Henlo, please note everything written after this statement may, or may not be, psyops. This is written for education and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Most of this was written by Napzilla who has a lot of bear jpegs and edited by Janitooor who also has a lot of bear jpegs and is also a seed investor in Berachain. Remember anon, do your own psyops.
    snapshot of a future bera historians library
    Henlo, and furthermore, Ooga Booga. This story begins as most epic stories begin: shitposting. And ends by having brought you, dear degen, up to date with the latest chapters in the unfolding story of the Beras. We’ll have arrived at the pending launch of a novel L1 and have shared tales of a >2000x (at modest estimates) return for OG holders of some distinctive NFTs. You will learn all about it very thooon. But first we should note that we’re embarking on a project which is doomed from the outset. There is really no way that any one person, group, or project could write a canonical Bonga Bera 101, as they’d miss so many chapters, pastas, and characters of this hilarious, ridiculous, deranged community and culture. Be that as it may, we will with a heavy heart, attempt to relay at least the tip of the iceberg for future polar bera archeologists. Just the tip.
    But where were we? Ah yes, shitposting. At first there was only shitposting. Olympus had taken off and the memes with it. In the Olympus discord, the off-topic channel was the center of the shitposting world. All day, every day the most mentally ill degenerates in all of crypto would be in there creating absurd copypastas, memeing everything, and paying Hard Rock Nick their hard-earned (via OHM rebase) money to FUD their own bags. Anyone who spent any significant amount of time with the off-topic Ohmies surely remembers it as one of the greatest experiences in their crypto journey. It was the best of times.
    For a brief period from August to November 2021, buying into anything OHM-adjacent was a sure bet. Every play printed money and the INCOOOM possibilities were impossible to ignore. An Ohmie releasing an NFT collection? A guaranteed 5x. A project where your OHM yield could be increased further? Better get in there. A way to leverage your staked OHM to buy more OHM, better known as (9,9)? YES SIR! On second thought, maybe you should be very careful about that one… Rome? Pls ser.
    We have found the first mention of "a project
    Enter Smokey the Bera (fka Patcho, the leader of the opposition to OIP-18) and Papa Bear. Smokey was always the face and primary shill of the project. Papa Bear was more lowkey since he was locked in the art dungeon being forced to draw the beras, but would occasionally be given a break to post a few messages. They started some classic off-topic shilling of their NFT project that Ohmies could not ignore: cute pictures of bears smoking bongs. The average off-topic Ohmie is about 100x more likely than the crypto population at-large to be a massive pothead, so this project resonated deeply. It didn’t take much to get buy-in from the newly wealthy degenerates who spent their days and nights posting “?hades” in Discord. These folks were sure to buy up a reasonably priced NFT made by two of their very own. At the time it was just a fun project targeted towards a raucous community who had money to spend, nothing more. Who could have predicted that buying a picture of a bear smoking a bong would be one of the most profitable plays in recent crypto history?
    Papa Bear has been written about elsewhere on the internet
    The Bong Bears mint occurred on August 27th, 2021. 100 absolutely zooted beras priced at .069420 ETH (~$225 at the time) each, plus 6 honoraries and 1 accidental duplicate (the glitch bera… devs were too damn high). The mint was unlike most others at the time. The standard process was (and generally still is) to click a mint button and receive a random NFT from the collection. But the beras have always done things a little differently. For this mint, all of the bong beras were available to view on OpenSea beforehand, so everyone could peruse the collection and choose the bear(s) that they wanted to buy before they were open for purchase. The technically illiterate (and generally illiterate) devs didn’t know what the hell they were doing, so they created the beras as OpenSea Shared Storefront NFTs (ERC-1155) instead of as their own contract (ERC-721). This would have future implications which will be discussed later, but at the time nobody in the community gave a shit, they just wanted something new and shiny to buy.
    Some things never change
    The price of gas was high on that fateful day in August, as it always was when the price of one Ethereum was over $3,000. In fact, the gas fee to purchase one OG bonga bera was almost as much as the price of the jpeg itself. This didn’t stop the Ohmies (and anyone else lucky enough to be aware of the sale) from buying every single one of those beautiful baked beras. The Bong Bears (and Olympus off-topic) discord was a madhouse during the mint. Each potential buyer had their eye on a bear or two that they would bid. Once the clock struck 8:00 EST, the Bong Bears minted out in about 30 minutes.
    Gas wars claimed more than a few casualties that day, as many hopeful buyers ended the frantic mint period as unfortunate noberas. Some of the more rare-looking beras, like the astronauts, had many people bidding, so those willing to pay the most in gas got the bears. It hurt to miss on the bera you wanted. Not just emotionally, but financially as well. Failing a $200 gas transaction is no joke, even for people making thousands of dollars (in OHM) every 8 hours. Some aspiring buyers failed one transaction and were unable to afford to try again for another bera. A true tragedy.
    Bong Bear #99, an objectively perfect bera
    As with any NFT mint, the flippooors surfaced in the following days. These paper-handed former beras flipped their future-generational-wealth-providing jpegs for fractions of an ETH. For the sake of their mental health, we hope that these individuals have not been following the trajectory of the beras after they sold. Speaking with some of the earliest OGs such as Kalius and tweakalot, they remember complaining (“WEN MARKETING”) that they’d been rugged (semi-sarcastically) because there was little to no communication for days… until Smokey showed them the light.
    The devs weren't deliver? Surprise surprise
    The flipping continued for a few weeks before stronger hands took control. The last sub-1 ETH sale occurred on September 24th, 2021, which non-coincidentally was the day of Olympus’s FOHMO 3.
    Olympus’s periodic FOHMO events are a way for the Ohmie community to take a peek behind the scenes to see what the team is up to. The events are (or at least were during the good ol days) a massive hypefest of (3,3) with Zeus and the Olympus team speaking about their ongoing work and allowing other community members to ask questions and talk about their own projects to a large audience.
    But FOHMO 3 was a very special one. OHM was at $600 each and climbing rapidly, and the Ohmies were in a frenzy. Upon joining the event held in the Olympus Discord, listeners were met with two bera profile pictures on the main stage, and many others in the audience. Zeus and Wartull, the founder and very early contributor of Olympus were rocking the fuck out of their honorary beras. The Ohmies took note with a little help from all the other beras spamming the chat, and the thin floor was swept, bringing the floor price up to 3 ETH, a low that was never seen again. Indeed legend has it that Zeus was the very first sweepooor of the bears.
    FOHMO 3 with the beras
    This dichotomy between left curve and right curve within the bera community has been a core pillar of the dynamic tension which has given the project and community such vibrancy. On the one paw, pictures of stoned bears loved by knuckle draggers, on the other paw pictures of stoned bears loved by some of the biggest gigabrains in CT and DeFi (Zeus, Wartull, DCF, etc). Throughout these early days, midcurvers (such as Mark11 on the Agora Podcast) were perplexed by these tensions. With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that these signals were early premonitions of how this tension would continue to build… but that’s getting ahead of ourselves. Suffice it to say these tensions still exist throughout DeFi and we can only ’majin the midcurve salty tears when the smell of honey wafts through CT like the lil cottage in Goldilocks…
    Both ends of the spectrum love the beras. The midcurves cannot be saved.
    Thus began the meteoric rise of the beras. In the aftermath of FOHMO 3, many beras exchanged hands. Nobody knew what was to come, they just liked the art. Many high-profile Ohmies were sporting bera pfps in Discord and on Twitter, and life was good. We will simply not mention anything that happened to OHM starting in December 2021, we will just focus on the success of the beras.
    Life was good if you were a bera. The Bong Bears discord was popping and the beras were shitposting their days away. But something was brewing. Something that would change the NFT game, and possibly the future of crypto.
    Every few weeks 
    Bonga Bera Pro did not come entirely as a surprise. Smokey and Papa dropped some hints in Discord, although most assumed it was just a meme due to the launch of Olympus Pro at around the same time (as well as the release of the new Bond movie - No Time to Die). Olympus Pro was a BONDing service that allowed other protocols to own their own liquidity via Olympus. The concept of rebasing, popularized by Olympus, was a millionaire-maker for Ohmies and was being duplicated ad-nauseam across every possible L1, becoming the second most forked contract in DeFi behind Uniswap. So why couldn’t an NFT rebase? As it turns out, they can, and on October 16th, 2021 (with based announcement video made by passytee of OhBabyGames) all OG Bong Bear holders were airdropped a brand new Bond Bear in their wallet, making the Bong Bears the first rebasing NFT ever. By this point, Smokey and Papa had looped in their ol’ bera fren Dev Bear to help make a contract. Little did Dev Bear know that this was the beginning of their cunning plan to entice him away from big FAANG tech to the world of bears. This meant there were also 25 Bond Bears available via contract mint, giving aspiring beras the chance to buy in for far less than it would cost to purchase an expensive OG. The bonda beras shared the art style of their predecessors, but these bears were James Bond themed. Get it? Olympus bonding and rebasing… rebased James Bond beras. You gotta love it.
    Bond Bear #119, one of my favorites
    Once the first bera rebase (or rebera) occurred and the bera devs released the roadmap showing many more rebases to come, the train could not be stopped. Bera holders unconditionally loved the beras for the art and vibes before this, but with an actual plan to give each holder exponentially more bears, the passion and belief in the project reached a whole new level. Bera believers went all-in on the project and started hoarding the Bong and Bond beras, knowing that they would generate a massive den down the line. And for the sharp eyed bears, it dawned that the Bongb Bears were indeed another 10k PFP Animal Drop, but being released through the novel mechanism of rebasing bears, with less than half released so far.
    The holy bera growth model
    The next rebase, The Boo Bears, arrived on October 29, 2021 with 271 bears (44 available for mint) decked out in festive costumes to celebrate Halloween. For this collection, the rebase NFTs were no longer beardropped into holder wallets (other than one legacy beardrop for each OG holder), but instead could be claimed through the Bong Bears website. An interesting aspect of these new beras is that some were wearing costumes representing protocols like TempleDAO and Rome (don’t judge, these were popular at the time), and certain community members wanted to get their hands on them. Consequently, the bera OTC market really started to heat up. This would be a good time to note that none of the bera collections have any attribute metadata, and therefore there's no way to rank rarity. All beras are 1/1s, just like each wonderful holder. This brings a unique element to the bears that almost no other collection can recreate. Holders are generally happy to straight up trade bear for bear because, as the saying goes, 1 bera = bera.
    Beras went to great lengths to find their familia
    It was around this time when the Bera community engagement reached a different level. An individual with formidable cleaning skills started DM-ing beras and sweeping floors at meme prices of 3.3 eth for Boos and 4.2 eth for Bonds. His name was Jani and he would go on to reunite dozens of families and adopt cubs and do seemingly -EV trades by swapping down collections and leaving oodles of ETH on the table while saying esoteric things such as “He who controls the floor, controls the beraverse.” Indeed Jani operated (with a lot of help from Kalius, the resident human-to-bera directory) as the de facto OTC bera clearing house for reuniting familia (by this point even midcurve Mark11 was aboard the bera train with Jani helping to bring the Olympus Agora podcast bera hohm) until the adoption of sudoswap as the preferred platform for reconnecting familia and the arrival of some janitors with larger dens… but more on that later.
    It was also around this time a certain wizard started sending feetpics to Zeus and blackmailing him together with his best friend, former fluffy gang member and lowlife, Mr Bera. You can see The Mr. Bera Adventures and follow the story here. Penny would go down in bera history for getting an OG Bong Bear for sending feet pics to a grown man for 69 days straight. Aspiring OF “models” take note.
    Boo Bear #143, fitting for the state of crypto in 2023
    Then came the babies. The Baby Bears collection dropped on December 16, 2021, right in time for the holiday season. Resident reporter FW remembers:
    ”This was when I joined, I remember it so vividly. At the time, 40-50 Beras were huddled up in VC. Papa, Devon, Smokey, Chupe, Kalius, $er, and the regulars all there. *The Website wasn't available so we had to mint DIRECTLY off the contract*. With a mint price of 0.42069 it was daunting for noberas to enter but some did.”
    OG (Glitch) Bong Bear #79 with corresponding Baby Bear #84
    This rebera included 571 babies, with 74 of those available to mint by the public. Indeed, many of the babies were Christmas and holiday-themed. While exciting and festive, these beras held another secret. Each bera from the previous collections had a baby version! The airdropped and claimed beras had no guarantee that the owner of the previous bera would receive the baby version of it. So of course, the bera community being the hilarious degenerates that they are set off to try to reunite “families.” In the weeks following, the bong beras Discord was alive with OG, Bond, and Boo bera owners trying to find a way to get their matching babies. If they were able to find the owner, many utilized the P2P swapping protocol sudoswap (now known as OTC sudoswap) to safely trade bera for bera. Some were successful, some are still looking to this day. Godspeed soldiers 🫡. But if we learned anything from the babies, it’s that the beras agree with Vin Diesel on one thing:
    Mi familia
    Over the months after the OG mint, the beras loved to joke about a “Berachain.” Sometime after the baby bera drop, Berachain took the giant leap from meme, to full-fledged reality. The devs decided to actually do something. Dev Bear (bearmo these days) joined the Bong Bears Discord in mid-November 2021 “part-time” and immediately joined in on the bera shenanigans, though we now know that the duo’s cunning plan had succeeded as they then became a trio. He waited a few weeks before dropping the most remarkable alfa on the unknowing beras.
    Dev dropped the alfa in November 2021 and you faded the beras, anon?
    Narrator: Smokey did indeed deck him
    So now some lucky beras were aware that there was potentially a chain in the works. Nobody knew the first thing about it, other than the name. The hype was generally contained within the Bong Bears Discord, but once the team was ready for a real announcement, nobody was truly ready for what was to come…
    From December 2021 to March 2022 A LOT happened. During the beginnings of what evolved into the latest bear market, the new and old beras started spending more time in Voice Chat (VC). From late night Poker games initially starting with OGs such as Kalius, Penny, and Kedi later joined by Chupe, $er, and even newer Beras like FW - a regular rotation of VC's started happening.
    Poker with frens
    Whether it was connecting over the fall of the OHM/Rome/bulla market, or bonding over these Bears Smoking Weed, the origin of "VC is where the real alfa happens” began. Even the newer entrants became giga Bullish. Whispers of this "BeraChain" would happen during these late night hang outs. Turns out, the Beras are gamers and the VC crew started playing Warzone together. Occasionally Dev Bear would join in VC and play, and then it became a regular occurrence. Between bopping noobs, the KeyBoardMaster (Dev) and the VC crew became tight. Also, during this time staples in the community such as PFP joined as well and countless lore, copypastas, and more were born.
    Leaked picture of Dev Bear with his proposal
    On March 14, 2022 Dev Bear posted a proposal in the OlympusDAO forum looking for comments on an upcoming proposal to have Olympus participate in a seed round for “BeraChain.” The proposal was seeking $500K in OHM (now worth about $3.50) for 2% of the genesis token supply at a $50M fully diluted valuation. The proposal received mostly positive comments, and a whole lot of “Berachain fixes this” copypasta. Four days later, the OIP-87 vote went live and passed with flying colors, with 78% of votes (118K OHM) in favor of proceeding with the partnership and seed. The other 33K OHM in votes… ngmi af. This was a major win for the beras, and further proof that Ohmies 🤝 beras.
    The very first "berachain fixes this"
    This was the beginning of the hard core memetics within the community. "Berachain isn't real", "Berachain fixes this," etc began here and turned out to be an effective method to gain traction in CT and Discord. This was also the beginning of Smokey’s reduction of the 5 minute elevator BD pitch to classics such as “Henlo'' and “Ooga booga” sprinkled with the occasional “furthermore.” From this point on, the beras were more than just a community of stoner degenerates. They were a community of stoner degenerates with a chain on the way. If it exists, that is.
    Which brings us to the Berachain Discord. A real Discord created for a fake chain. A testament to the hubris of humanity. It opened to the public on April 3rd, 2022 and the beras started filing in. Two days later, Smokey posted a cryptic announcement:
    “Berachain is not an EVM-compatible blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK and is mostly definitely not launching this summer on a brand new Proof of Liquidity consensus engine. Since Berachain isn’t real, we will not be rolling out any additional information about chain mechanics, partnerships or fundraising over the next few weeks.”
    Historians still have no idea what the hell he was talking about, but in crypto, if you build it, the degenerates will come. So they came, and being degenerates and all, they aped hard into every bera NFT available. Floor prices skyrocketed as everyone looked for any smidgeon of exposure to Berachain, which again, did not and does not exist. It was during these wonderful times that new janitors stormed the scene: BurstingBagel, BeraMan69, and Digits Capital to name a few, but we’re of course forgetting many, many more.
    Z dropping facts
    From April to August 2022 the Beras really began to gun the marketing engine. From podcasts to Twitter Spaces it seemed that Berchain was becoming more real. During this period, the market exploded after the Terra Luna situation, so pivots had to happen and things went into hibernation for a bit. During this time, the bears rebased. Who would’ve thought that during the down only market, these GUD JPEGS of Bears smoking weed would be making people lots of $HONEY.
    Around this time Some Canadian Beras met up in Montreal. PFP began grinding out Stickers and creating bera memes just because he was passionate about the community. This led to lots of memes, copypastas, and emotes that are still used to this day. Community events such as Poker Nights, Spaces, and a Rap Night continued happening with regularity that coincided with the opening of the new server.
    Let’s get back to the NFTs for a minute. The beras had to wait patiently for the next rebase. The devs would like you to believe that the increased focus on Berachain was the reason it took so long, but the reality is that Papa Bear (still locked in his art dungeon) had a lot of drawing to do to produce the fourth rebase: The Band Bears. Another very fun to collect set, the banda beras are a collection of 1,175 jammin beras released on 4/20/22 (blaze it). The public was able to mint 107 of them, which continued to expand the community. Each of these musical beras was styled after a musician. Somehow, with this new art the bera team had managed to create an even more compelling way to encourage users to trade for beras that fit their taste. It was not uncommon to see wild OTC trades like Johnny Cash for Bob Dylan or Future for George Michael. Each artist had both an OG version and a baby version, so it was possible to collect both variants of Chad from Nickleback… if that’s what you’re into.
    Papa knows
    It was around that time that some events unfolded which make an honorable mention to $er, who Papabear has called “the backbone of the community,” worthwhile. As well as being the self described “Mall Cop of the Bongbears,” $er has been one of the OGs stoking the cultural fires of the beras and looking out for the underberas since OG times. Here is how Sila, a fellow community member, puts it: “0xSerJaMad was the first person in crypto to guide me through it all, saved me from multiple rugs and taught me how to mint from the contract. 99% of the time if he’s got beef with someone he’s both right and looking out for the smaller individual. Seriously the man will look out for other sometimes to his own detriment.”
    As with every rebera, the next one was a stealth drop. The 2,355 Bit Bears by Berachain (what does it mean??) were born on August 24, 2022. Those with Honeylist in the Berachain Discord got a head-start of a couple minutes on the public to snag the 112 mintable ones, but almost everyone squandered the opportunity because they thought the announcement was a scam. Crypto is a traumatizing place, so you can’t blame them too much, you can only feel sorry that they missed out on an incredible opportunity. This batch of NFTs had a different art style than the rest, replacing the jovial signature designs of Papa Bear with pixelated little beras courtesy of PixelBera (who is developing Beratone which allows you to play with your lil bittys in-game).
    A full familia of beras, courtesy of our very own FW
    Building off of a proven successful idea, the Bit Bears collection contains an 8 bit version of every prior bera. As you can imagine, once the beras revealed a week or so (it felt like months) after the mint, owners of every prior rebase immediately went hunting for their little pixel bois. One of the most efficient ways to reunite families was through the new and improved sudoswap.
    In the previous months the chads at sudoswap had released a 0 to 1 innovation in NFTFi, enabling pools (either single sided or LP) with various configurable curving mechanics. Gigabrain bera, DeFi Ted of ParagonsDAO, was the bera visionary who paved the way for later berawhales (janitors) such as BurstingBagel, BeraMan69, deepname99 and Digits Capital to add pools for bits, bands, babys, boos, and bonds. It caught on like wildfire and adoption of sudoswap gave the community unprecedented ability to essentially swap any two bears without the hassle of finding an individual to trade with.
    We could say more, but that’s a topic for another day when we’ll talk more about bera adoption of other tools such as Llamalend (borrow and lending against bears), Puttyfi (exotic options, puts, calls on bears), Caviar (fractionalising bears) and more. Suffice it to say whenever the beras jump into a new NFTfi service, adoption is massive (in some cases >95% of volume are the beras). To put this into perspective, volume across each of the rebases on sudoswap, at time of writing, is 2226 ETH which puts the Bong Bear rebases into spot #4 on sudoswap, and that doesn’t even take into account OTC and volume on other services.
    Basically free at these prices
    There is still one more planned rebase left, and it’s potentially the most exciting one yet. This will be the most accessible collection yet, as it will spawn 4,713 new beras into the ecosystem, with 115 available for mint. As Smokey hinted at on The HoneyCast (check out the whole thing, but specifically at around 40:00 for this alfa), this rebase is expected to occur on Berachain. Everything has been building up to this, and the team will certainly deliver another incredible set of blazed beras.
    You now know at least the tip of the iceberg of what there is to know about the Bong Bears. If you haven’t been too stoned whilst reading this, you now understand that the Bong Bears are indeed just another 10k Animal PFP Drop, which have so far given OGs a > 2000x return with the final rebera still on the way. IYKYK this has been a 0 to 1 innovation in community building, NFT distribution, and ecosystem development. When compared to other NFT collections, the Bong Bears and all their rebases need to be considered as a single collection to be able to make an apples-to-apples comparison. Even then, which other NFT project builders have the cajones to attempt an L1? Which L1 has seeded their ecosystem with a fanatical community with early stakes in the ecosystem? And all without a penny spent on marketing. What will the future hold for these zooted degens? When will The March of the Beras occur? Nobody knows for certain, but one thing is for sure: it has been one hell of a journey. Now go read Berachain, Cults and the Dawn of The Honey Jar if you haven’t already and learn about the FAT Bera Thesis. You will be glad that you did.
    Ooga Booga.

    Wallets first onchain interactions
    Research by Ryan Watkins of Syncracy Capital has shown that 80% of wallets created in 2022 first interacted with NFTs. With this explosion of NFTs over the past two years, there has been a common thread between many of them. Projects start with an NFT, then if they have success in that endeavor, they look to add value for their communities. As we pointed out in Honey Jar 101, the majority of these types of collections offer limited and specific functionality for their jpegs. Twitter legend @evabeylin of e-girl capital and The Graph, published a thread breaking down a view of the NFT landscape in a post royalties-era saying those projects deploying lower velocity and higher scarcity would be less affected than higher velocity lower scarcity projects. We also happen to think the landscape as presented further illustrates our point. In addition to the strategies visualized in Eva’s image, collections may also produce derivative collections, and in a small number of cases they may branch out into DeFi functionality like staking. But these instances are rare and have not yet penetrated the mainstream imagination for what is possible. It may seem like that is the case for the evolution of the Bong Bears, but in reality it is quite the opposite. Read our Bong Bears 101 article for a deep dive into the origin of the beras and how this venture differs from all other NFT projects.
    NFT landscape
    If you’re too damn lazy (or illiterate) to read the article, I’ll give a brief explanation on why the beras are special. The origin of the Bong Bears is rooted in DeFi. The founders, Smokey and Papa, were DeFi addicts long before cooking up the idea for the beras. The project initially gained traction in the Discord of a DeFi project: Olympus DAO, but very quickly expanded to become an entirely new kind of project. The degenerates residing in the off-topic channel were the ones to initially ape into the project and propel it to success. It’s safe to say that from its very beginnings, the Bong Bears was an NFT project with a DeFi soul. So what? I’ll tell you what.
    Onchain DeFi actions of NFT buyers
    Up to this point, there has been very limited overlap between NFT users and DeFi users. Twitter user ElBarto_Crypto, a researcher at Block119, put together a very informative thread looking into how these two types of users essentially live in different universes. As noted earlier, throughout 2022, 80% of new wallets’ first action was NFT related. Out of those users, the ones who have branched out into DeFi tend to interact with NFT-adjacent coins such as $LOOKS and $APE, and not the types of tokens and protocols that have been traditionally linked to DeFi usage. About 30% of wallets with an NFT have made a DEX (decentralized exchange) trade, only 13% have made a stablecoin transfer, and less than 1% (!) have deposited an NFT as collateral and borrowed funds against it.
    This builds a strong case suggesting that the public has bought into the idea of NFTs, but are either unaware, or not sold on the use-cases of DeFi, or do not have the technical skills and understanding necessary to succeed in the DeFi world. On the other hand, the research shows that 70% of DeFi users do not buy NFTs! A shocking revelation to those of us who are so entrenched in the crypto world that we assume that everyone is taking advantage of all that crypto has to offer. At the end of the thread, ElBarto_Crypto questions the conclusion that in the future there will be high demand for NFTFi (NFT x DeFi), since there appears to be such a large gap between the two user bases. While we find the analysis brilliant, we couldn’t disagree more with the conclusion, ser! We feel that this scene hasn’t even gotten started yet, and that The Honey Jar is well positioned to be this bridge - to be an NFT gateway to DeFi.
    The Honey Jar has come to the following conclusion: The Bong Bears x Berachain is the logical intersection of these universes with undeniable growth potential. The Honey Jar will integrate some of our beloved DeFi tools like swaps and borrowing/lending right into our website, and will even offer a 50% discount on our NFT mint if DeFi coins are used to purchase, as well as some more integrations in future versions.
    So we know that the beras are deeply ingrained in DeFi, and also enjoy some gud jpegs. Already, this puts the community in an advantageous position - a group of apes, or beras, already fluent in NFTFi. But let’s examine just how degenerate they are.
    Bong Bears Dune Dashboard Analytics
    As we identified in Bonga Bera 101 the Bong Bears and all rebases can be considered a single ~10k drop which has been slowly released over sub-collections, or reberas as we like to say. Kofi has created an incredible dashboard that aggregates the trading volume of all the Bong Bear rebases, identifying that the bears are in the top 10% of all NFT collections by secondary sales volume, not taking into account OTC volume. Over the counter refers to when people trade person to person, rather than buying from an initial mint. When purchases are handled through NFT marketplaces this is also sometimes referred to as “secondary sales.” All this volume has come from fewer than 1,000 holders with $0 spent on marketing from the Bong Bear (or Berachain) team. In fact, it could be said that these jpegs ARE the marketing, but more on that in an upcoming article.
    Back to the data. The results are astounding. Not only are new beras being onboarded from normie NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, but there are a significant amount of sales and trades coming from non-traditional avenues. At the time of writing, there have been over 729 ETH worth of bera trades from traditional user-to-user OTC, sudoswap OTC, and sudoswap pools just in January and February 2023. Compare this to the 802 ETH of secondary-sales volume done on OpenSea, Blur, LooksRare, and X2Y2 over the same time frame. Crypto users are acquiring beras through DeFi-adjacent means at almost the same rate as through traditional means. This is absolutely unprecedented! This community is not made up of normies, it is comprised of a demographic that appears to be the target of the next generation of protocols: NFTFi users.
    Llama tech institutional shout outs
    But do the beras stop there? Do they grab up a picture of ursine David Bowie off of sudoswap and just sit on it? No, of course not… these are DeFi degenerates we are talking about here.
    Let’s start with Llamalend. Llamalend is built by 0xngmi and team, some of the many Llamas behind DeFiLlama. DeFiLlama is public goods infrastructure, funded entirely by donations, which has fast become one of the premier tools utilized by the industry. If you have ever read a news article with a chart containing crypto stats, or a report coming from the government, some corporate entity, or a large exchange, it is very likely they got their analytics data from these Llama tools. So let's jump into this curious case of Llamalend!
    The biggest downside of holding illiquid jpegs is just that - they are illiquid. Until recently, the only way to unlock the ETH held in NFTs was to sell them. You couldn’t have your honey and eat it too. But why not? Llamalend is a protocol that allows users to deposit their NFT and borrow ETH against them - the cornerstone of NFTFi. We call this using an NFT as collateral, just like you can take out a loan on a house. Users can deposit NFTs into isolated user-created pools in order to borrow ETH without risk of liquidation due to price fluctuations, as long as they pay off their loan by the due date. You can read their docs to learn more.
    Beras and Llamas, a match made in heaven
    The beras LOVE the llamas. As the data has shown, the trading activity of beras is massive - but this has not always been recognized by the first generation of NFTFi projects which have tended to be permissioned. This means that the teams who build the protocols also elect which NFT collections those protocols will support, and they have generally only supported bluechip collections that have garnered mainstream attention. You can read more about some of these projects in this excellent thread by @GatheringGewi. But where were we? Oh yeah - bears LOVE the llamas as they built a tool that allows beras to provide services to other beras. This is the definition of permissionless - a tool which anyone can pick up and use - like a shovel!
    480/524 (92%) of ETH borrowed is bears. Interestingly, the other 40 ETH Art Gobblers liquidity is also supplied by a bera ;)
    From day one, the beras aped into Llamalend and quickly amassed 100+ ETH volume in borrowing and lending, and the protocol volume has been dominated by the bear rebases ever since. To this day, the various bera collections make up about 75% of all volume on the protocol, an overwhelming percentage. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. DeFi natives with valuable jpegs are bound to find a way to make them productive. For more insights into what it looks like when the beras sink their teeth into something new and financially beneficial, take a look at the Llamalend dashboard. As the following image (which we got from DeFiLlama) shows the protocol is incredibly efficient in yielding higher fees than even AAVE. Those of us who know that bear jpegs are pristine collateral have been loving this shovel.
    Fees by TVL berry gud
    But how are bears so sure that their jpegs make such good collateral? For something to be considered good collateral it needs the following qualities according to Nasdaq:
    “Good-quality collateral has the four characteristics of: (i) having an easily ascertainable value that is sufficient to cover the loans that it is securing; (ii) retaining its value through the entire period of the loan; (iii) being readily for foreclosure or of having its ownership easily transferred; and (iv) being liquid.”
    (i) As we have seen from the Dune dashboards, the bears have seen a large amount of price discovery by the market
    (ii) Bears have been one of the best stores of value throughout this latest bear market
    (iii) Bears in LlamaLend are held by smart contract until the end of the term
    Price discovery of bit bears
    (iv) Liquidity - Let’s look a little deeper into this:
    Beras simply cannot limit themselves to borrowing and lending. They can’t help but to throw themselves headfirst into any innovative NFTFi products. Sudoswap is another place where the beras are putting numbers on the board. Sudoswap is an automated market maker (AMM) that facilitates NFT-to-token and token-to-NFT swaps. Someone with a bear jpeg can deposit it into a pool and automatically accept crypto for that bear according to the pool’s configuration.
    When you buy a bear jpeg with crypto, it is a bit like swapping USD to your local currency and back again, but with jpegs and crypto. Users can utilize pools of NFTs to easily buy, sell, or trade NFTs. How is this significant? BOL - Bear Owned Liquidity. Simply put, if someone supplied you with a bear jpeg with the click of a few buttons, you would be able to easily convert your bear into crypto. But why is this liquidity so thicc?
    As noted in previous articles, all bong bear collections are unique in that there are no metadata traits assigned to each NFT, and therefore no differences in rarity. This has proved to be a major boon to their NFTFi adoption. Whereas holders of other collections may be hesitant to supply pools with their NFTs because there is no promise that they will be able to get an equally rare one back, the beras can be sure that if they so choose, they are guaranteed to get an equivalent NFT back. So the beras got down to business supplying pools and collecting the sweet, sweet yield that comes with it. When considered as a collective, the Bong Bear rebases are in the top three of all collections by volume on sudoswap. Not too shabby.
    Aggregate volume of bears and rebases on sudoswap
    All of this can all be attributed to the DeFi nature of the beras. It is not enough for them to hold their beloved jpegs as they 10x, 100x, 1000x. They need more to satisfy their deeply held DeFi desires. They must turn it all into one big NFTFi game. They want to borrow against their bears so that they have liquidity to make big DeFi plays. They then take their winnings and buy more bears. They know what they have, and they make it work hard for them.
    All in all, the Bong Bears are in the top 10% of all NFT projects by OTC volume. The beras are clearly NFTFi power users. And as extraordinary as all of the above data is, we still need to once again put it into context: All of this has been carried out by fewer than 1,000 unique holders of Bong Bear NFTs. 1,000 raucous holders. $0 spent on marketing, and the bera collections are doing 10% of the volume of Bored Ape Yacht Club. Can you imagine what might happen if more attention falls on the bear jpegs? If they start being mentioned alongside the bluechips that have penetrated mainstream attention? And what about when Berachain launches? If you don’t know about Berachain, learn about it in our Berachain, Cults and the Dawn of The Honey Jar article.
    The degeneracy of the beras cannot possibly be overstated. One of the smaller (for the time being) communities has been putting the NFT world on notice. And all of this has been achieved before Berachain even exists! The Dawn of BeraFi is upon us, anon.
    What’s Next?
    The Bong Bears have always been programmed to be a top 1% bluechip project. It is nearly impossible to have observed everything that has occurred over the past year and a half and not see the writing on the cave wall. The beras live and thrive outside of the traditional crypto boundaries. They are coming for you, your ETH, your DeFi yield, and maybe even your wife and her boyfriend.
    The stage has been set for a monumental shift in crypto. We have watched as normie NFT projects that attempt to branch into DeFi have not found much success. We have recognized how DeFi projects that extend into NFTs have not gained much traction. And most importantly, we have seen how NFTs have onboarded many new users into crypto, but there has not yet been that much-needed 0 to 1 innovation to convert them into full-blown DeFi users. Berachain is that innovation, with The Honey Jar providing the NFT gateway to DeFi. Berachain - a novel L1 with a meme name supported by a cult of the foremost NFTFi users in all of crypto. To paraphrase Bane from Batman:
    Oh, you think DeFi is your ally. But you merely adopted DeFi; The beras were born in it, molded by it. We didn't see the NFTs until we were already men, by then they were nothing to us but GUD JPEGS!
    Berabane
    Berachain will be a brand new playground for normies and degenerates alike. If NFTFi on Ethereum is checkers, NFTFi on Berachain will be 5D backgammon on Pluto. Prepare accordingly.
